    "# üîç Introduction to Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    " In this notebook, we explore **AI search** ‚Äî a critical capability that combines information retrieval with artificial intelligence to enable smarter, context-aware search experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional keyword-based search systems often struggle with:\n",
    "- Understanding the *meaning* behind user queries.\n",
    "- Returning *relevant* results when vocabulary differs.\n",
    "- Scaling across large, unstructured datasets (e.g., documents, emails, knowledge bases).\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Search** addresses these limitations by integrating:\n",
    "- **Semantic understanding**: using embeddings to capture the meaning of text.\n",
    "- **Hybrid retrieval**: blending traditional keyword matching with vector similarity.\n",
    "- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: enabling generative answers based on search context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand different types of search: **keyword**, **vector**, and **hybrid**.\n",
    "- Use **Azure AI Search** with **Azure OpenAI embeddings** to implement vector and hybrid retrieval.\n",
    "- Apply a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LLMs** to answer natural language questions based on enterprise content.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/) ‚Äî an enterprise-grade search engine with semantic and vector search.\n",
    "- [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/) ‚Äî for embedding generation and LLM-based responses.\n",

    "## üß† Vector Search: semantic similarity based on embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector search allows us to search using **semantic meaning** rather than exact keywords. It relies on **embeddings** ‚Äî high-dimensional representations of text ‚Äî to capture the contextual meaning of a query and match it to similar content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use vector search\n",
    "‚úÖ When queries are written in **natural language** (e.g., ‚Äúhistoric hotel walk to restaurants and shopping‚Äù).  \n",
    "‚úÖ When you're looking for results that are **contextually or conceptually** similar, not just exact matches.  \n",
    "‚úÖ In discovery or exploration scenarios where **intent matters** more than wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When not to use it\n",
    "üö´ When you require **precise keyword matches** (e.g., compliance codes, product names).  \n",
    "üö´ When your data is not embedded or doesn‚Äôt include vector fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to generate an embedding from a user query, then perform a **k-NN (nearest neighbor)** search over the vector field `DescriptionVector`. The results are hotels whose descriptions are semantically close to the query.\n"

    "Reranking is a technique that takes an initial set of search results and reorders them to improve their relevance to the user‚Äôs query. Unlike simple ranking based only on keyword matches or vector similarity, reranking uses advanced models (often based on large language models or semantic understanding) to better assess how well each result matches the query intent.\n",
