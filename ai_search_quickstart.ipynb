Toenails and fingernails are similar, except that toenails grow four times more slowly. Only certain mammals have nails: mostly, they are found in primates. They are made of the same kind of material (keratin) as the claws of other animals.\\n\\nLike hair, nails never stop growing. They must be cut from time to time. It does not hurt when people cut their nails as they are not innervated.  The nails are made up of a protein called keratin which also makes up the main element of hair and skin. People paint their nails to make themselves look more attractive, usually females. On occasion nails can grow into the skin acting as a place of infection known as an ingrowing nail. They can hurt, so are often treated through medicine. The cutting and painting of the nails is called a manicure.\\n\\nFunctions \\nThe functions of nails are not obvious. They include:\\n\\n Protecting the fingertip and the surrounding soft tissues from injuries. \\n Helping delicate movements of the fingertips by allowing counter-pressure on the pulp of the finger. The nail then acts as a counterforce when the end of the finger touches an object. This improves the sensitivity of the fingertip, even though there are no nerve endings in the nail itself. \\n The nail is a tool. For example, when a person pulls out a splinter in a finger. Also, it may be used for some cutting or scraping actions.\\nFingernails are a part of the body often used for display in females.\\n\\nRelated pages \\nNail art\\nManicure\\nBody art\\nCosmetics\\nLipstick\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nLimbs and extremities\\nIntegumentary system', '@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

In other words, if something is sexually exciting, then it is said to be erotic. Eroticism is an erotic feeling. It is named after Eros, the Ancient Greek god of love.\\n\\nMany types of things can be part of eroticism. Things that make a person feel erotic (sexually aroused or excited) include the sight, touch, smell, and sound of another person. A person may feel erotic when they see or touch or smell, or hear someone that they love in a sexual way. \\n\\nSometimes eroticism has nothing to do with another person. A person might feel erotic from watching a movie, looking at pictures in a magazine, listening to a piece of music, reading a story or article, or just thinking their own thoughts, or being aware of their own body. In fact, everything can be eroticism for someone.\\n\\nWhat makes eroticism?\\n\\nSome things are designed and made especially to make people feel erotic. Things that are designed to make people feel erotic are called \"erotica\". This word is most often used for art, books and magazines.\\n\\nArt  Sometimes artists create erotic works of art such as drawings, paintings and sculpture. They might do this because they want to make a record of a person or a relationship that is special to them. But more often, artists make erotic art for people who would like to buy it. \\nBooks Many books have been written that tell erotic stories, or which give advice about how to make love in an erotic way.\\nMovies Many people enjoy watching erotic movies. \\nMagazines Many magazines have lots of photos of people naked or in sexy clothing, and with erotic expressions and gestures (actions). \\nAvertising Erotic photos are often used for advertising. For example, a beautiful young woman with an erotic expression on her face might be used to advertise hair products, clothes, chocolates, cars, and all sorts of other things. \\nClothing Some clothing is designed to look erotic. Some underwear, in particular, is especially designed to look erotic. \\nFood Some food is said to make people feel erotic. Food can also be used as an erotic sign or be eaten in an erotic way.\\nPerfume Many perfumes have substances in them that effect the human brain in a way that makes a person feel erotic.\\n\\nEroticism and pornography\\n \\nMost people believe there is a difference between erotica and pornography, but some people have argued that all erotica is \"pornographic\". (In other words, some people believe that all pictures, movies or writing which are sexually exciting are rude and wrong, and should not be made.)\\n\\nPeople who have studied this subject say that erotica is not harmful to anyone, and may be helpful with people\\'s loving relationships. The same writers say that pornography, which generally shows a person being treated without respect or love, is not helpful with people\\'s loving relationships.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Sex \\n Pornography\\n Romance (love)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHuman sexuality', '@search.score': 0.01587301678955555, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It is a garment of a skirt (bottom half) with an attached bodice (top half). The colouring and style of the dress gives the effect of a one-piece garment. A dress is also known as a frock or a gown. In Europe and the Americas, dresses are worn by females of all ages as an alternative to a separate skirt and blouse or trousers.\\n\\nThere are many types of dresses. A dress is usually worn at formal occasions, such as a wedding or a dance. It is also worn in the summer to keep cool. Younger females tend to prefer shorter skirts than older females.\\n\\nType of dress\\nAfternoon dress \\ncocktail dress\\nEvening dress\\nSaree\\n\\nHistory \\nIn the 11th century, women in Europe wore dresses that were like men\\'s tunics and were loose with the hem(the very bottom cloth of a dress) below the knees or lower. \\n\\nLater in the 1550s French women were inspired by Spanish-style bodices and also wore ruffs(a frilly circle worn on the neck). In England, Queen Elizabeth said what kinds of dresses women could wear. \\n\\nDuring the 17 century, Lace and slashing(when fabric is layered and cut so it feels like velvet) became popular decorations. Skirts were full, and the overskirt(the skirt worn over all the others) allowed the display of an underskirt of contrasting fabric. Necklines became lower as well.\\n\\nSkirts were wide and supported by hoop underskirts in the 18th century. One-piece gowns were popular until the middle of the century. During the 1760s in France, hoop petticoats(undergarments like skirts) were reduced in size. Women also liked lighter colors and lighter fabrics.\\n\\nWomen\\'s dresses in the 19th century began to be sorted by the time of day or purpose of the dress. Dresses with high waists were popular until around 1830. Europeans styles in dresses increased quickly to the hoop skirt and the crinoline using styles of the 1860s. Dresses had \"day\" bodice with a high neckline and long sleeves, and an \"evening\" bodice with a low neckline and very short sleeves. Skirts of the 1860s had a lot of decoration.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites\\nStylopedia -- an online dictionary of fashion details \\nApparelSeach glossary of textile and apparel terms\\nAn international dress size converter', '@search.score': 0.01515151560306549, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It works by removing parts of the music that people can not hear. A good AAC encoder can compress CD quality music to about 10% of its original size without affecting the perceived sound quality.\\n\\nProfiles \\nThere are several profiles (variants) of AAC. These are the most popular:\\n AAC LC – Standard AAC profile with no extensions. All AAC players support this profile. This is the format used by Apple (iPod / iPhone), Sony (Walkman), and many others; it takes up more space, has high audio quality, and is used for music stored on an iPod, CD-ROM, or disk drive.\\n HE-AAC v1 – AAC with Spectral Band Replication - a more efficient format; it saves space for music sent over a network, like over the Internet or to a cell phone, although at the cost of sound quality. Brand names for this format include aacPlus™, Nero Digital™, and AAC+. A variant of this format is used for HD Radio.\\n HE-AAC v2 – AAC with Spectral Band Replication and Parametric Stereo - an even more efficient format for music sent over a network, although at the cost of reduced stereo separation.

      "{'title': 'Paint', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint', 'text': 'For the computer software named Paint, see Microsoft Paint\\n\\nPaint is the general term for liquid that is used to add colour to the surface of an object by covering it with a pigmented (coloured) coating.  As a verb, painting means \"applying paint\" (putting paint onto something). Someone who paints is called a painter.\\n\\nPaint is made from a coloured pigment which is usually a powder. The powder is made from different chemicals. Some of the pigments come straight from natural things like clay. The pigment must be made wet by mixing it with something that will make it stick onto the surface and not come off easily. The wet stuff is called the \"medium\" or \"vehicle\". Some paints are just mixed with water. Other paints are mixed with oils or chemicals of different sorts. Most painters buy paint that is already mixed. House-painters use paint already mixed in large cans. Artists buy paint in tubes. Some artists buy dry pigment and mix it for themselves.\\n\\nThe paint is usually put onto the surface with a paint brush. Paint brushes are used by painters of all sorts. House painters also use rollers and spray-guns to put on paint. A modern invention is paint in a pressurized can which can be sprayed on. Some modern artists also use spray paint. In factories there are machines which spray paint onto objects. Cars are usually painted in this way.\\n\\nPaint must be allowed to dry. Some paints such as watercolour, dries in a few minutes. Other paints, such as artist\\'s oil paint, can take days or even weeks to dry. Most other types of paints fit between these two. Many types of paint are best if they are put on in several layers. The painter must first prepare the surface so it is smooth, clean and dry. The first layer of paint is often an \"undercoat\" or \"ground\" which is smooth and sticks very well. The coloured paints are put on over the top. A house-painter who is using oil paint on a wooden window frame might used three layers of paint to give very good protection from the weather. Other types of modern house paint only need one layer, particularly on the inside. Artists using oil paint and tempera often use many layers to get just the right effect.\\n\\nUses of paint \\n\\nPaint has four important uses.\\n\\nProtection \\nPaint is used to protect all sorts of buildings and structures from the effects of water and sun. Wooden buildings such as houses are usually painted because a coat of paint prevents water seeping into the wood and making it rot. The paint also helps to prevent the wood from drying out in the hot sun.\\n\\nMetal structures and objects of all sorts are painted to stop them from rusting. A very large steel structure such as a bridge must have a team of painters who keep the paint in good condition all the time.\\n\\nDecoration \\nPaint is used to decorate all sorts of objects. Since pre-historic times, people have painted the inside walls of their houses to make them look attractive. Painting and decorating the exterior (outside) and interior (inside) of houses is an important industry in many countries. There are many types and colours of paint to chose from.\\n\\nAll sorts of other objects are painted to make them attractive. This includes furniture, toys, tools and utensils, and street fittings. Sometimes things made of wood such as furniture are painted in decorative patterns. In some countries, many people enjoy decorating furniture and other small things like trays and boxes. This is one form of what is often called Folk Art. In other countries such as Japan, painting furniture is a very skilled profession and an antique piece of decorated furniture is very valuable. \\nOther people enjoy the hobby of painting small objects such as model planes or soldiers.\\n\\nArt \\n \\nPaintings are pictures that are done in paint. Many different types of paint are used for paintings. They include tempera, oil paint, gouache, watercolours and acrylic paints. The paintings are usually done on board, canvas or paper. Many other famous paintings are done on the walls and ceilings of buildings, such as the Sistine Chapel ceiling which was painted by Michelangelo.\\n\\nMany artists are famous for their painted pictures. Old, beautiful and famous paintings are very valuable and are sometimes sold for millions of dollars. Famous painters include Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian and Rembrandt.\\n\\nInformation \\nPaint is a very good way to give important information to people, using painted signs. Painted signs include lane markings on the road, street signs of all sorts, advertising signs and warning signs.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Tempera \\n Oil paint\\n Oil painting \\n Watercolour\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n History of Paint \\n\\nBasic English 850 words', '@search.score': 0.013513513840734959, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

All of the speech was in three languages that were spoken at the time of Jesus: Latin, Greek and Hebrew. The movie spent a lot of time showing details of the suffering and death of Jesus, with lots of violent scenes. Mel Gibson said that this was a realistic showing of what happened, though others thought it showed too much violence.\\n\\nJewish groups and Christians objected to the movie because it showed the Jewish leaders arranging to have Jesus killed. There were also other depictions in the film of Jews that many Jews and Christians felt was controversial. They said that this would cause people to think that modern-day Jews were guilty because of this and increase antisemitism and inaccurate beliefs of Jews. The movie makers said that this was not their intention, however criticism from both sides continued and still persists to this day.\\n\\nMel Gibson was unable to get support from movie studios for this movie, and so supplied the money for it (around $25 million) mostly himself.

Natural sciences include, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, and physics. Science uses mathematics and logic, which are sometimes called \"formal sciences\". Natural science makes observations and experiments. Science produces accurate facts, scientific laws and theories. \\'Science\\' also refers to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process.\\n\\nResearch uses the scientific method. Scientific research uses hypotheses based on ideas or earlier knowledge, which can be categorized through different topics. Then those hypotheses are tested by experiments.\\n\\nPeople who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called scientists. Scientists study things by looking at them very carefully, by measuring them, and by doing experiments and tests. Scientists try to explain why things act the way they do, and predict what will happen.\\n\\nScientific method \\nToday, \"science\" usually refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not just the knowledge itself. It is mainly about the phenomena of the material world. The Greek works into Western Europe from the 6th to 7th century B.C. revived \"Philosophy\". In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature such as Newton\\'s laws of motion. And during the 19th century, the word \"science\" became more and more associated with the scientific method itself. It was seen as a way to study the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology.\\n\\nIt was also in the 19th century that the term scientist was created by William Whewell. He meant it tell the difference between those who looked for knowledge on nature from those who looked for other types of knowledge.\\n\\nThe scientific method is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge. The main features of the scientific method are:\\n Scientists identify a question or a problem about nature. Some problems are simple, such as \"how many legs do flies have?\" and some are very deep, such as \"why do objects fall to the ground?\"\\n Next, scientists investigate the problem. They work at it, and collect facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look carefully.\\n Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest ideas, and test them out. They do experiments and collect data.\\n Eventually, they find what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell people about it.\\n Later, other scientists may agree or not agree. They may suggest another answer. They may do more experiments. Anything in science might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough.\\n\\nAn example \\nA famous example of science in action was the expedition led by Arthur Eddington to Principe Island in Africa in 1919. He went there to record where the stars were around the Sun during a solar eclipse. The observation of where the stars were shown that the apparent star positions close to the Sun were changed. In effect, the light passing the Sun was pulled towards the Sun by gravitation. This confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity, published in 1915. Eddington\\'s observations were considered to be the first solid proof in favour of Einstein\\'s theory.\\n\\nPractical impacts of scientific research \\nDiscoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing.

Some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted for the time being. They last as long as they are the best explanation. When theories no longer explain the data, they are removed and replaced. Or, sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than remove it, or they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually.\\n\\nScience is a way to get knowledge by getting rid of what is not true.\\n\\nScientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure. They compete to provide better explanations. An explanation might be interesting or pleasing, but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation.\\n\\nBefore a scientific article is published, other scientists read the article. They decide whether the explanations make sense from the data. This is called peer review. After articles are published, other scientists will also check to see if the same experiments, observations or tests produce the same data again. Peer review and repeating experiments are the only way to be sure the knowledge is correct.\\n\\nScience makes models of nature, models of our universe, and medicine. There are many different sciences with their own names. However it is not right to say \"science says\" any one thing. Science is a process, not just the facts and rules believed at one time.\\n\\nSome types of science \\n\\n Natural sciences\\n Biology\\n Zoology\\n Botany\\n Genetics\\n Ecology\\n Physiology\\n Astronomy\\n Earth science\\n Meteorology\\n Geology\\n Oceanography\\n Physical sciences\\n Physics\\n Chemistry\\n Social sciences\\n\\n Anthropology\\n Psychology\\n Sociology\\n Economics\\n Political science\\n Social work\\n Linguistics\\n Formal and applied sciences\\n Computer science\\n Engineering\\n Mathematics\\n Statistics\\n Medicine\\n\\nRelated pages \\n History of science\\n Philosophy of science\\n Science tourism\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n \"How Do We Know What Is True?\" (animated video; 2:52)\\n\\nBasic English 850 words', '@search.score': 0.01315789483487606, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'North Sea', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20Sea', 'text': \"The North Sea is a sea that is part of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Europe. The North Sea is between Norway and Denmark in the east, Scotland and England in the west, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in the south.\\n\\nBorders \\nThe Skagerrak connects the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. In the south, the North Sea becomes the English Channel, a sea between England and France. This is called the Dover Straits and is very busy with ships.\\n\\nThe border between the North Sea and the Skagerrak is at an imagined line between Lindesnes in Norway, and Hanstholm in Denmark. In the North, the North sea is open towards the Atlantic. The border between the two is an imagined line from Northern Scotland, to Shetland, and then to Ålesund in Norway. According to the Oslo-Paris Treaty of 1962 it is a bit more to the west and the north though. The treaty puts it at 5° East longitude, and 62° North latitude. That is at the parallel of the Geirangerfjord in Norway.\\n\\nVarious statistical data \\nOn average, the North Sea has a depth of only 94 meters. About 80 million people live near the North Sea, at most 150\\xa0km away from the coast. Together with the English Channel in the south, the southern North Sea is the busiest body of water in the world.\\n\\nRivers that drain into it \\nWell-known rivers that drain into the North Sea include the Tay (at Dundee), the Forth (at Edinburgh), the Tyne (South Shields), the Wear (at Sunderland),  the Tees (near Middlesbrough),  the Elbe (at Cuxhaven), the Weser (at Bremerhaven), the Rhine and Meuse or Maas (at Rotterdam), the Scheldt (at Flushing or Vlissingen), the Thames, and the Humber (at Hull), and the river Nairn (at Nairn)\\n\\nThe Kiel Canal, one of the world's busiest artificial waterways, connects the North Sea with the Baltic.\\n\\nName \\nIts name comes from its relationship to the land of the Frisians (see Frisia). They live directly to the south of the North Sea, and to the west of the East Sea (Oostzee, the Baltic Sea), the former South Sea (Zuiderzee, today's IJsselmeer) and the today reclaimed Middle Sea (Middelzee). But the spread of the name could also be from the view of the cities of the Hanseatic League. Some of its main cities, like Lübeck, Bremen or Hamburg had the same view.\\n\\nIn classical times this body of water was also called the Oceanum Germanicum or Mare Germanicum, meaning German Ocean or Sea. This name was commonly used in English and other languages along with the name North Sea, until the early eighteenth century. By the late nineteenth century, German Sea was a rare, scholarly usage even in Germany. In Danish the North Sea is also named Vesterhavet (besides Nordsøen), meaning Western Ocean because it is west of Denmark.\\n\\nGeographic divisions \\n\\nMost of the North sea is on the European Continental shelf. On average, the depth is about 93 to 94 meters only. In the south it is very shallow, only 25 to 35 meters. In the north in the bathyal zone north of Shetland, this depth increases to between 100 and 200 metres. In the south, the depth is at most 50 metres. An exception to this is the Norwegian Trench. It is deepest there, with a depth of 725 metres. The most shallow part of it is a sand bank called Dogger Bank. In the southern part, there are many sand banks.\\n\\nLooking at the satellite picture it is easy to see the geographic divisions of the North Sea:\\na generally shallow southern North Sea\\nthe central North Sea\\n the northern North Sea, with the Norwegian Trench, near the Skagerrak.\\n\\nThe southern north sea is composed of the Southern Bight, before the coast of Belgium and the Netherlands and the German Bight before the coastline of Germany. The Dogger Bank is the limit between the southern and central parts. The Waddenzee runs all the way from Den Helder in the Netherlands to Esbjerg in Denmark.\\n\\nThe Dogger Bank covers an area about half the size of the Netherlands. There, the North Sea has a depth of between 13 and 20 metres only. The area is very famous for fishing. With some storms there are even waves breaking there.\\n\\nThe Norwegian Trench has an average depth of around 250 to 300 metres; at the entrance to the Skagerrak, the depth increases up to 725 meters. Along the trench is the Norwegian Current, which brings most of the waters of the North Sea into the Atlantic Ocean. Also, most of the waters of the Baltic Sea flow northwards here.\\n\\nAbout 200\\xa0km east of the Scottish city of Dundee there are more trenches, known collectively as the Devil's hole. Generally, the water is about 90 meters deep there. The trenches very often are only a few kilometers in length. In these trenches, the depth increases to up to 230 meters.\\n\\nIn the Dover Strait the water is about 30 meters deep. At the end of the English Channel, this depth increases to about 100 meters.\\n\\nHistory \\nIn the last ice age the North Sea was covered by large areas of ice called glaciers. About 20,000 years ago the ice melted and the North Sea was formed (made).\\n\\nNorth Sea oil \\nIn the 1960s, geologists found large areas of oil and natural gas under the North Sea. Most of the oil fields are owned by the United Kingdom and Norway but some belong to Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. Drilling began in the 1960s and led to a famous argument between England and Scotland about how the revenue (money) from the oil should be spent.\\n\\nAnimal life \\n\\nPeople have been fishing in the North Sea for thousands of years. However, so many fish are now caught there that new ones may not be able to grow fast enough to keep the fishery going.\\n\\nTerns, Atlantic puffins, razorbills, kittiwakes and other seabirds live on the North Sea coast.

It is a part of the United States Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard\\'s purpose is to protect the people, environment, industry and security of the United States on seas, lakes and rivers.  To do this, the Coast Guard uses boats, ships, helicopters and airplanes to stop smuggling and other crime and terrorism, and to rescue ships and boats in danger.\\n\\nThe Coast Guard traces its roots back to the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which was created by Congress on 4 August 1790. As such, the Coast Guard is the oldest continuous seagoing service of the United States. \\n\\nThe modern United States Coast Guard was started on January 28, 1915. This is when the U. S. Congress ordered the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service to merge into a single service. The Coast Guard can become part of the Department of the Navy during war, but it is not now. It became part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2003.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe U.S. Revenue Cutter Service (USRCS) was set up in 1790 when President George Washington signed an act allowing the building of 10 boats called \"cutters\". The service was first suggested in a letter by Alexander Hamilton as a way to collect tariffs which were being lost to smuggling. They were also tasked with making sure shipments of goods from the United States were getting through to markets in other countries. The first Coast Guard station was in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Until the re-establishment of the Navy in 1798, the Revenue Cutter Service was the only naval force of the early United States. \\n\\nThe modern Coast Guard can be said to date to 1915, when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the U.S. Life-Saving Service when Congress formalized the existence of the new organization. In 1939, the Lighthouse Service was brought under the Coast Guard\\'s purview. In 1942, the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation was transferred to the Coast Guard.\\nIn 1967, the Coast Guard moved from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to the newly formed U.S. Department of Transportation, an arrangement that lasted until it was placed under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2003 as part of legislation designed to more efficiently protect American interests following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.\\n\\nIn times of war, the Coast Guard or individual components of it can operate as a service of the Department of the Navy. This arrangement has a broad historical basis, as the Coast Guard has been involved in wars as diverse as the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War, in which the cutter Harriet Lane fired the first naval shots attempting to relieve besieged Fort Sumter. The last time the Coast Guard operated as a whole within the Navy was in World War II. More often, military and combat units within the Coast Guard will operate under Navy or joint operational control while other Coast Guard units will remain under the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences \\n\\n \\n1790 establishments in the United States', '@search.score': 0.012820512987673283, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

When he was a boy Max helped his father to rebuild an organ that was going to be thrown away. This was the instrument on which he learned to play. It was some time before he started proper lessons, but by the time he was a teenager he was playing the organ for church services. When he was 15 he went to Bayreuth to hear Wagner’s operas. This was the moment when Reger decided he wanted to become a musician.\\n\\nReger studied music in Munich and Wiesbaden with a famous teacher Hugo Riemann. He composed a lot of music, especially for the organ. His musical style was similar to that of Brahms, but he also learned a lot from the music of Bach, Mendelssohn and Schumann. He liked the symphonic poems of Liszt and these gave him the ideas for writing chorale fantasies for the organ, although he never wrote music that tells a story (programme music).\\n\\nIn 1902 Reger married. He and his wife adopted two children. In 1907 he became professor of composition at the University of Leipzig. He was a very good teacher. He became well-known abroad. He travelled to London where he spent hours in the art galleries. Then he bored his friends by talking all the time about the paintings. He conducted the orchestra at Meiningen, performing works by many composers, especially Brahms, Bruckner and his own.\\n\\nReger enjoyed eating and drinking. He regularly went to his local café where he would eat ten large sausages and drink ten glasses of beer. His health got bad, and he died of a heart attack in Leipzig, where he was visiting friends on his way home from the Netherlands.\\n\\nWorks \\nReger wrote an enormous amount of music, but very little of it is played nowadays. He wrote in a late-Romantic style. He is best remembered for his organ music. He liked to write fugues and sets of Variations.

      "{'title': 'Ninja', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja', 'text': 'A ninja is a kind of spy or assassin who lived in Japan beginning in the 14th century.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nNinja (or shinobi) were a mystery in the History of Japan. The correct Japanese word for these warriors was shinobi-no-mono, which literally means \"people who survive/endure\". Ninja is easier to say; this is why it is more widely used. Shinobi-no-mono is the native Japanese word for ninja, while ninja is the Sino-Japanese word. Ninja warriors created secret associations and took part in many political killings. Their mystery comes from two ideas: 1) they always participated in secret spy operations and political killings; 2) ninja were hired by heads of armies as paid warriors (mercenaries). The art of fighting which was used by ninja was called ninjitsu, which was a combination of shinobi-no-jitsu and shinobi-jitsu.\\n\\nMany people thought ninja were not normal people. People believed they could fly and had supernatural skills. Ninja existed during the entire history of Japan, but ninja only became specially trained people at the beginning of the 15th century. They mainly trained in the regions of Iga and Koga. \\n\\nNinja were involved in samurai wars and were hired by samurai for different missions, but at the same time samurai did not accept them as noble warriors because most of the ninja came from lower social classes. They were dangerous and could not be controlled. Their methods of fighting did not fit the samurai code. The samurai code was a code of honor. For example, the samurai warrior would show his rank and would only fight a samurai of equal or higher rank. Japanese land lords (daimyo) widely used the services of the Iga and Koga ninja in the period of 1485-1581. But in 1581, one of the three daimyo who united Japan – Oda Nobunaga attacked ninja from Iga province. The ninja remained alive and ran to the provinces Kii and Mikawa, where Tokugawa Ieyasu protected them. Later, Oda Nobunaga was killed by a samurai named Akechi Mitsuhide, who later became an enemy to Tokugawa Ieyasu.\\n\\nThe art of ninja fighting was passed down from father to son, or from master (sensei) to their best students. But in the middle of 17th century, Nakagawa Sosuntzin created a ninja school in the Mutsu Province. It was called Nakagawa-ryu and taught the ninjitsu method of fighting. Nakagawa Sosuntzin himself trained a group of 10 men, which he called Hayamiti-no-mono (men of the short hit). Ninja were taught many more things than a samurai. They had to be skilled at handling swords, spears, bows and many other weapons; but also they had to know about explosive and poisonous substances, to be a good path finder and to survive in different situations. Usually they were trained from young age and had to keep a very specific physical shape. Ninja were not allowed to be too light or too heavy. A ninja who could read and write was very appreciated.\\n\\nNinja clothing and equipment\\n\\nIt tends to be thought that a ninja usually wore black clothes which helped him to hide in the dark, however, they wore dark blue, red, or brown clothes, which are more quiet than black at night. In usual days, a ninja never wore showy dress and pretended to be another job, for example, a merchant, a traveling monk, a monkey showman and so on. If they had to fight on the battlefield, they put on a light armor, which protected them, but also allowed easy movement. On their feet they wore Japanese socks which separated the big toe (the socks were called tabi). The ninja outfit had many pockets for helpful gear. Chain armor was normally beneath their cloak in-case danger came their way like an ambush.\\n\\nThe diversity of ninja weapons and attributes is much wider than that of the samurai. The main weapon of ninja was the sword. Ninja swords were usually shorter than samurai katana and had a straight blade. When they climbed, the sword was put on the left shoulder, putting the handle of the sword was close to the left ear. Ninja also used different types of throwing knives, and a weapon for their fists called tagaki. They used metallic claws on their feet which helped them to climb and made their kicks more dangerous.\\n\\nThey are also very close to the other form of Japanese killer, a samurai.\\n\\nAs with Robin Hood or King Arthur, the ongoing presence of ninja in pop culture movies and manga often differs widely from their true origins.\\n\\nRelated pages\\nSamurai\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\nMethods of Fighting and Ninja Wearing Apparel \\nHanami Web - Ninja \\n\\nSamurai\\nOccupations\\nJapanese culture', '@search.score': 0.012195121496915817, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Central processing unit', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central%20processing%20unit', 'text': 'A central processing unit (CPU) is an important part of every computer. The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer, almost like how a brain controls a body.\\n\\nThe CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of computer things to do, called instructions. It reads the list of instructions and runs (executes) each one in order. A list of instructions that a CPU can run is a computer program.\\n\\nThe clock rate, or speed of a CPU\\'s internal parts, is measured in hertz (Hz). Modern processors often run so fast that gigahertz (GHz) is used instead. One GHz is 1,000,000,000 cycles per second.\\n\\nMost CPUs used in desktop (home) computers are microprocessors made by either Intel or Advanced Micro Devices (usually shortened to AMD). Some other companies that make CPUs are ARM (recently bought by Nvidia), IBM, and AMD under ATI Technologies, which is the leader right now. Most of their CPUs are used in embedded systems for more specialized things, like in mobile phones, cars, video game consoles, or in the military.\\n\\nTypes of CPUs \\n\\nIn the 20th century engineers invented many different computer architectures. Nowadays most desktop computers use either 32-bit CPUs or 64-bit CPUs. The instructions in a 32-bit CPU are good at handling data that is 32 bits in size (most instructions \"think\" in 32 bits in a 32-bit CPU). Likewise, a 64-bit CPU is good at handling data that is 64 bits in size (and often good at handling 32-bit data too). The size of data that a CPU handles best is often called the word size of the CPU. Many old CPUs from the 70s, 80s and early 90s (and many modern embedded systems) have an 8-bit or 16-bit word size. When CPUs were invented in the middle 20th century they had many different word sizes. Some had different word sizes for instructions and data. The less popular word sizes later stopped being used.\\n\\nMost CPUs are microprocessors. This means that the CPU is just a single chip. Some chips with microprocessors inside them also contain other components, and are complete single-chip \"computers\". This is called a microcontroller.\\n\\nRegisters \\nWhen the CPU runs a computer program, it needs somewhere to store the data that the instructions operate on (the data that they read and write). This storage is called a register. A CPU usually has many registers. Registers must be very fast to access (to read and write). Therefore, they are part of the CPU chip itself.\\n\\nMemory \\nStoring all data in registers would make most CPUs too complicated (and very expensive). Therefore, registers usually only store the data that the CPU is working on \"right now\". The rest of the data used by the program is stored in RAM (Random Access Memory). Except in microcontrollers, RAM is usually stored outside the CPU in separate chips.\\n\\nWhen the CPU wants to read or write data in RAM, it outputs an address to that data. Each byte in RAM has a memory address. The size of addresses is often the same as the word size: A 32-bit CPU uses 32-bit addresses, etc. However, smaller CPUs, like 8-bit CPUs, often use addresses that are larger than the word size. Otherwise the maximum program length would be too short.\\n\\nBecause the size of addresses is limited, the maximum amount of memory is also limited. 32-bit processors can usually only handle up to 4 GB of RAM. This is the number of different bytes that can be selected using a 32-bit address (each bit can have two values—0 and 1—and 232 bytes is 4 GB). A 64-bit processor might be able to handle up to 16 EB of RAM (16 exabytes, around 16 billion GB, or 16 billion billion bytes). The operating system may limit it to using smaller amounts.\\n\\nThe information that is stored in RAM is usually volatile. This means that it will disappear if the computer is turned off.\\n\\nCache \\nOn modern computers, RAM is much slower than registers, so accessing RAM slows down programs. To speed up memory accesses, a faster type of memory called a cache is often put between the RAM and the main parts of the CPU. The cache is usually a part of the CPU chip itself, and is much more expensive per byte than RAM. The cache stores the same data as RAM, but is usually much smaller. Therefore, all the data used by the program might not fit in the cache. The cache tries to store data that is likely to be used a lot. Examples include recently used data and data close in memory to recently used data.\\n\\nOften it makes sense to have a \"cache for the cache\", just as it makes sense to have a cache for RAM. In multi-level caching, there are many caches, called the L1 cache, the L2 cache, and so on. The L1 cache is the fastest (and most expensive per byte) cache and is \"closest\" to the CPU. The L2 cache is one step away and is slower than the L1 cache, etc. The L1 cache can often be viewed as a cache for the L2 cache, etc.\\n\\nBuses \\nComputer buses are the wires used by the CPU to communicate with RAM and other components in the computer. Almost all CPUs have at least a data bus - used to read and write data - and an address bus - used to output addresses. Other buses inside the CPU carry data to different parts of the CPU.\\n\\nInstruction sets \\nAn instruction set (also called an ISA - Instruction Set Architecture) is a language understood directly by a particular CPU. These languages are also called machine code or binary. They say how you tell the CPU to do different things, like loading data from memory into a register, or adding the values from two registers. Each instruction in an instruction set has an encoding, which is how the instruction is written as a sequence of bits.\\n\\nPrograms written in programming languages like C and C++ can\\'t be run directly by the CPU. They must be translated into machine code before the CPU can run them. A compiler is a computer program that does this translation.\\n\\nMachine code is just a sequence of 0s and 1s, which makes it difficult for humans to read it. To make it more readable, machine code programs are usually written in assembly language. Assembly language uses text instead of 0s and 1s: You might write \"LD A,0\" to load the value 0 into register A for example.  A program that translates assembly language into machine code is called an assembler.\\n\\nFunctionality \\nHere are some of the basic things a CPU can do:\\n\\n  Read data from memory and write data to memory.\\n Add one number to another number.\\n Test to see if one number is bigger than another number.\\n Move a number from one place to another (for example, from one register to another, or between a register and memory).\\n  Jump to another place in the instruction list, but only if some test is true (for example, only if one number is bigger than another).\\n\\nEven very complicated programs can be made by combining many simple instructions like these. This is possible because each instruction takes a very short time to happen. Many CPUs today can do more than 1 billion (1,000,000,000) instructions in a single second. In general, the more a CPU can do in a given time, the faster it is. One way to measure a processor\\'s speed is MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second). Flops (Floating-point operations per second) and CPU clock speed (usually measured in gigahertz) are also ways to measure how much work a processor can do in a certain time.\\n\\nA CPU is built out of logic gates; it has no moving parts. The CPU of a computer is connected electronically to other parts of the computer, like the video card, or the BIOS. A computer program can control these peripherals by reading or writing numbers to special places in the computer\\'s memory.\\n\\nInstruction pipelines \\nEach instruction executed by a CPU is usually done in many steps. For example, the steps to run an instruction \"INC A\" (increase the value stored in register A by one) on a simple CPU could be this:\\n Read the instruction from memory,\\n decode the instruction (figure out what the instruction does), and\\n add one to register A.\\n\\nDifferent parts of the CPU do these different things. Often it is possible to run some steps from different instructions at the same time, which makes the CPU faster. For example, we can read an instruction from memory at the same time that we decode another instruction, since those steps use different modules. This can be thought of as having many instructions \"inside the pipeline\" at once. In the best case, all of the modules are working on different instructions at once, but this is not always possible.\\n\\nMemory management units (MMUs) and virtual memory \\nModern CPUs often use a memory management unit (MMU). An MMU is a component that translates addresses from the CPU to (usually) different RAM addresses. When using an MMU, the addresses used in a program are (usually) not the \"real\" addresses where the data is stored. This is called virtual (the opposite of \"real\") memory. A few of the reasons why it is good to have an MMU are listed below:\\n An MMU can \"hide\" the memory of other programs from a program. This is done by not translating any addresses to the \"hidden\" addresses while the program is running. This is good because it means that programs can\\'t read and modify the memory of other programs, which improves security and stability. (Programs can\\'t \"spy\" on each other, or \"step on each other\\'s toes\".)\\n Many MMUs can make some parts of memory non-writeable, non-readable, or non-executable (meaning code stored in that part of memory can\\'t be run). This can be good for stability reasons and security reasons, as well as for other reasons.\\n MMUs allow different programs to have different \"views\" of memory. This is handy in many different situations. For example, it will always be possible to have the \"main\" code of a program at the same (virtual) address without colliding with other programs. It is also handy when there are many different pieces of code (from libraries) that are shared between programs.\\n MMUs allow code from libraries to appear at different addresses every time a program is run. This is good because not knowing where things are in memory often makes it harder for hackers to make programs do bad things. This is called address space randomization.\\n Advanced programs and operating systems can use tricks with MMUs to avoid having to copy data between different places in memory.\\n\\nMultiple cores \\nMulti-core processors became much more common in the early 21st century.  This means that they have many processors built on to the same chip so that they can run many instructions at once.  Some processors may have up to sixty-four cores, like the upcoming AMD Epyc \"Milan\" series. Even processors for consumers have many cores, such as the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 5950x.\\n\\nMultithreading \\nSome processors have a technology known as multithreading. This is the task of running more than one \"thread\" of instructions in an operating system. Many modern processors use this to boost performance with heavy multi-threaded programs, such as benchmark programs.\\n\\nManufacturers\\nThe following companies make computer CPUs:\\n ARM\\n Intel\\n Advanced Micro Devices\\n MCST\\n SRISA\\n Sun Microsystems\\n\\nFurther information \\n Microprocessor\\n ALU\\n Execution unit\\n Floating point unit\\n Intel\\n AMD\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n Central processing unit at Citizendium\\n\\nMicroprocessor design', '@search.score': 0.012048192322254181, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

They are often called the laughing hyena. They are found almost everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals, though their population is getting smaller in the wild. This is because of habitat loss and illegal hunting. They lived in Europe for at least a million years until the end of the Pleistocene.\\n\\nThe spotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae. They are the most social Carnivora animals, with various group sizes. Hyenas are pack hunters. Their behaviors are still not well understand. However, their social system is not cooperative but competitive. Females take care of their own cubs only, and males are not interested in helping females with their cubs. Females are larger than males and they can control them. The females are the only mammalian species not to have a vaginal opening.\\n\\nThe spotted hyena is a successful scavenger as well as hunter They can eat skin, bone and other animal waste. Spotted hyenas hunt with a family group of about two to five other hyenas. The family lives in large communities (called \"clans\") which may have up to 80 individuals.\\n\\nThey  run around herds of animals and choose one to attack. After they have selected their prey, they  chase them for a long time. They can run at speeds up to 60\\xa0km/h. Humans have known spotted hyenas for a long time. In the Upper Paleolithic, humans made paintings of hyenas in caves. Spotted hyenas have a negative reputation in Western culture and African folklore.

He was born in Caracas, Venezuela. He liberated many countries from Spain in South America. Those countries included Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. For a few years he was president of Gran Colombia, a country that no longer exists. The country Bolivia is named after Bolívar.\\n\\nEarly life \\nSimón Bolívar was born in Caracas into a very rich family that owned plantations, ranches, mines, and many slaves who they forced to work in their businesses. His full name was Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios Ponte-Andrade y Blanco. He was sent to school in Spain like many children of rich families were at the time. While he was in Madrid, Bolívar married María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaiza in 1802. He also learned about the ideas of the Enlightenment.\\n\\nRevolution in Latin America \\nWhite people felt ignored because Spaniards were sent by their governor, and resented wealthy mixed heritage people who could “buy” whiteness.  The creoles started calling themselves Americans and not Spaniards to demonstrate that they wanted independence. In 1808, Napoleon conquered Spain, and made his brother, Joseph Bonaparte the new king.  The colonies in Latin America rebelled because they said they were loyal to the old king, Charles IV of Spain and not Napoleon.\\n\\nOn September 6th 1815 Simón Bolívar wrote a letter from Jamaica. He explained the causes and reasons why all of South America or parts of it should be independent (free from Spain\\'s ruling).  Simón Bolívar was tired of how Venezuela and other countries were treated like slaves and how they were not free. He said “We have been harassed by a conduct which has not only deprived us of our rights but has kept us in a sort of permanent infancy with regard to public affairs.” He kept saying in the Jamaica letter why it\\'s important to be free. “We are still in a position lower than slavery, and therefore it is more difficult for us to rise to the enjoyment of freedom.”  This means they could not even enjoy freedom.  \"Because successes have been partial and spasmodic, we must not lose faith. We are young in the ways of almost all the arts and sciences, although, in a certain manner, we are old in the ways of civilized society.\"   \\n\\nOn May 26, 1819 Bolívar gathered with a group of guerrillas that wanted to defeat the Spanish army. They got supplies and they crossed hundreds of miles of plains, swamps, rivers, etc. Many of the men died of hunger, diseases, and other causes on the way there. Crossing plains on August 7, they encountered the royalists and won the battle in Boyacá on August 10. Bolívar then occupied Boyacá, Colombia. Bolívar won the fight of Carabobo in June 1821, and then another in Caracas. A few days later and Venezuela was free of the Spanish royalists, then Bolívar went South and conquered Quito. On July 27, 1822 Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín met in the Guayaquil Conference.  They were preparing to march across the Andes to Peru to defeat the Spanish royalists in August of 1824.  San Martin resigned his powers in Peru and went back to Argentina.  Later he went to Europe.  Bolívar launched his campaign and soon he won a small but important battle at Junín.  The royalists retreated and eventually lost. \\n\\nBolívar said that his people were in a position \"lower than slavery\", but many of them  owned slaves themselves. Alexandre Pétion, the president of Haiti, said that he would help Bolívar fight if he abolished slavery as part of independence. Bolívar agreed, but only because he was afraid the slaves would revolt against the slaveowners, like they did in Haiti, and he only freed slaves who agreed to fight in his army. Even though Pétion helped him, Bolívar never freed all the slaves, and slavery was not abolished until the 1850s in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. \\n\\nHe is still remembered and celebrated for helping many of the Latin American countries achieve independence.  People called him \"El Liberator\" because of this. Some people hated him because they thought he was a traitor, and he was going to be a dictator.\\n\\nOther websites \\n Simon Bolívar\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1783 births\\n1830 deaths\\nDeaths from tuberculosis\\nPresidents of Colombia\\nPresidents of Venezuela\\nPresidents of Bolivia\\nPresidents of Peru\\nPeople with foods named after them\\nPeople from Caracas', '@search.score': 0.011363636702299118, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

Tanks have tracks that wrap around its wheels to spread out its weight and let it cross rough ground. Most tanks have a powerful gun and one or more machine guns. \\n\\nA tank's crew is normally 3-5.

They were called tanks to trick the Germans into thinking they were water carriers for the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. Their use in a surprise attack in the Battle of the Somme caused fear among the German soldiers but their small numbers and poor reliability prevented them from making much difference.\\n\\nTanks became a main weapon during World War II, where battles between great numbers of tanks were fought, especially between the Germans and the Soviet Union. The Battle of Kursk was the biggest. Well-known World War II tanks were the German Panzer IV, Panther and Tiger I, Soviet T-34 (produced in the largest numbers of any tank of the war and second most ever), British Matilda, Churchill and Cromwell, and American M4 Sherman (second most produced tank of the war) and Stuart tanks. There had also been plans for much larger and more heavily armoured tanks such as the Maus but these were determined to be of little use due to their huge weight, which would have made moving them very difficult, and the huge size, which would have made them easy targets for heavy artillery.\\n\\nOld tanks are often modified for other uses like carrying soldiers or equipment. Combat engineers use special tank-based vehicles, for example minesweeper tanks or bridge-layer tanks.\\n\\nThe tank is a major part of all large armies today. Tanks have replaced the cavalry everywhere and do the things that soldiers on horseback did in the past. Most modern tanks are of the heavy or Main Battle Tank type, able to fight other tanks.

It is one of the four countries that make up the\\xa0United Kingdom. It is west of England, and east of the Irish Sea and Ireland.\\n\\nWales is one of the six\\xa0Celtic nations. The native people of Wales, the Welsh, have their own culture and traditions. They have their own Celtic language, Welsh. Although not all Welsh people can speak Welsh, it is a real living language for about 20% of Welsh people. Nearly all Welsh people can speak English. Some of them speak only English. The Welsh language has official status in Wales. \\n\\nThree million people live in Wales. Most of them live in the southern and eastern parts of the country. In this area is the capital and largest city of Wales, Cardiff, and the next largest city, Swansea.\\n\\nHistory \\nPeople have lived in Wales for at least 29,000 years. The Romans first entered Wales in 43 AD, and took it around 77 AD.\\n\\nThe word \\'Wales\\' \\nThe English words Wales and Welsh come from the old Germanic word\\xa0Walh (plural:\\xa0Walha).\\xa0Walh itself came from a Celtic tribe, called the\\xa0Volcae by the\\xa0Romans. That was eventually used for the name of all Celts and later to all people who lived in the\\xa0Roman empire. The\\xa0Anglo-Saxons who lived in\\xa0England and who spoke\\xa0Old English called the people living in Wales\\xa0Wælisc and the land itself\\xa0Wēalas. Other names that come from these origins\\xa0Wallonia,\\xa0Wallachia, and Vlachs.\\n\\nIn the past, the words\\xa0Wales and\\xa0Welsh were used to mean anything that the\\xa0Anglo-Saxons associated with the Celtic Britons. That included Cornwall, Walworth, and\\xa0Walton, as well as things associated with non-Germanic Europeans like\\xa0walnuts.\\n\\nThe modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry, and Cymru which is the Welsh name for Wales. These words are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning \"fellow-countrymen\"\\n\\nConquest by Edward I and brief independence under Owain Glyndŵr \\nAfter Llywelyn ap Gruffudd died in 1282, Edward I of\\xa0England\\xa0finished his conquest of Wales, which made it a part of England.\\xa0Owain Glyndŵr\\xa0was a Welsh leader who fought against English rule in the early 15th century. However, after he was defeated by the English, the whole of Wales was taken over by England, with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542.\\n\\nLaws in Wales Acts and annexation by England \\nIn the 16th century, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 were passed in England while\\xa0Henry VIII\\xa0was king there. These added Wales to England. They also said that people who spoke Welsh instead of English could not hold public office.\\n\\nIndustrial Revolution \\nWales is on ancient rocks which were once in the roots of great mountain systems. In the last three centuries the products of those rocks have transformed what was once an agricultural landscape.\\n\\nRocks were smelted to release copper and iron, key products needed by the industrial revolution. Coal itself is moved by canals and later by rail to England.\\nSocial justice was needed for the workers who came into Wales to do this work.\\n\\nAt the start of the\\xa0industrial revolution, the\\xa0mining\\xa0and\\xa0metal\\xa0industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial country. The new jobs in South Wales caused a quick rise in the number of people living in Wales. This is the reason why two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, mainly in the capital\\xa0Cardiff\\xa0(Caerdydd), as well as\\xa0Swansea\\xa0(Abertawe),\\xa0Newport\\xa0(Casnewydd), and in the nearby valleys. Now that the coal industry has become a lot smaller, Wales\\' economy depends mostly on the\\xa0public sector, light and service industries and\\xa0tourism. In 2010, the Gross Value Added of Wales was £45.5 billion - £15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain.\\n\\nReturn of Welsh identity and devolution of Government \\nIt took until the 19th Century for Welsh-centric politics to return to Wales.\\xa0Liberalism in Wales, which was introduced in the early 20th century by Lloyd George, was overtaken by the growth of socialism and the\\xa0Labour Party. However, Welsh pride got stronger, and in 1925\\xa0Plaid Cymru was made, which was the first political party to campaign for Welsh independence. In 1962, the Welsh Language Society was made to encourage the\\xa0Welsh language, which had nearly disappeared during the take over by England. A big change was made in 1998, when the first Government of Wales for the country since its addition to the United Kingdom under the Government of Wales Act (1998). This created an Assembly for Wales, known in Welsh as the senedd. The Senedd has responsibility for a range of laws which have been\\xa0devolved from the main\\xa0UK government in\\xa0Westminster. This means the members of the Assembly can change certain laws in Wales to be different to the rest of the UK.\\n\\nGeography \\nWales has a coastline which is 1680 miles long, and the country itself is 20,779\\xa0km2\\xa0large. The highest mountains in Wales are in\\xa0Gwynedd, in the north-west, and include\\xa0Snowdon (), which is the highest peak in Wales at 1085 m (3,560\\xa0ft). There are three National Parks in Wales:\\xa0Snowdonia (), Brecon Beacons (), and\\xa0Pembrokeshire Coast ().\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nLocal government\\nWales is divided into 22 council areas. These areas are responsible for local government services, such as education, social work, environment and roads services.\\n\\nThe list to the right of the map shows counties, unless they are marked *, meaning they are cities, or † for County Boroughs. Welsh-language forms are given in parentheses.\\n\\nWelsh identity \\nWelsh people are very proud of their country. The first people in Wales to call themselves \\'Welsh\\' were the Celts. The Celts lived in Wales after the Romans left in the 5th century. The national emblems of Wales are\\xa0leeks and\\xa0daffodils.\\xa0\\n\\nAlthough Wales is very close to the rest of Great Britain, and despite most people speaking\\xa0English, the country has always had a distinct\\xa0culture. It is officially\\xa0bilingual in English and Welsh. Over 560,000 people in Wales speak the\\xa0Welsh language. In some parts of the north and west of the country, particularly in small, rural communities, the majority of people speak\\xa0Welsh.\\n\\nFrom the late 19th century, Wales became famous as the \"land of song\", and for its\\xa0Eisteddfod culture festival. At many international sport events, for example the\\xa0FIFA World Cup, the\\xa0Rugby World Cup, and the\\xa0Commonwealth Games, Wales competes on its own, as a separate country. However, at most international events, such at the\\xa0Olympics, Wales competes with the rest of the Great Britain, and sometimes as the\\xa0United Kingdom with\\xa0Northern Ireland included.\\xa0Rugby Union is strongly associated with Wales as a national sport.\\n\\nFamous Welsh people \\n Richard Burton (Actor)\\n Dylan Thomas (Poet)\\n Geraint Thomas (Tour de France Winner)\\n Jo Walton, Welsh-Canadian fantasy and science fiction writer and poet\\n Tom Jones (singer)\\n Greaser Gang \\n Catherine Zeta-Jones (actress)\\n Shirley Bassey (musician)\\n Charlotte Church (musician)\\n Gareth Bale (footballer)\\n Marina and the Diamonds (musician)\\n Owain Glyndŵr (fighter)\\n Griff Rhys-Jones (comedian, actor, presenter)\\n Andrew Chase (sculpture artist)\\n Roald Dahl (writer)\\n Iwan Rheon (actor)\\n Laura Ashley (fashion)\\n Jeff Banks (fashion)\\n Rhod Gilbert (comedian)\\n Ruth Jones (comedian, actress)\\n Paul Whitehouse (comedian, actor)\\n Rob Brydon (comedian, actor)\\n Siân Williams (news reporter)\\n Mattew Tuck (musician)\\n Taron Egerton (singer, actor)\\n\\nTransport\\n\\nRoads \\nThe main road on the coast of South Wales is the M4 motorway.

The main road between North and South Wales is the A470 road, which goes from the capital Cardiff to Llandudno.\\n\\nAirports \\nCardiff International Airport is the only large airport in Wales. It has flights to Europe, Africa and North America and is about  southwest of Cardiff, in the Vale of Glamorgan.

      "{'title': 'April', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/April', 'text': 'April is the fourth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and comes between March and May. It is one of four months to have 30 days.\\n\\nApril always begins on the same day of week as July, and additionally, January in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as December.\\n\\nApril\\'s flowers are the Sweet Pea and Daisy. Its birthstone is the diamond. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\\n\\nThe Month \\n\\nApril comes between March and May, making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.\\n\\nApril begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other\\'s last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\\n\\nIn common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\\n\\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\\n\\nApril is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\\n\\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\\n\\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\\n\\nApril in poetry \\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter.

      "{'title': 'Feminism', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism', 'text': 'Feminism is a social, political, and economic movement. Feminism is about changing the way that people see male and female rights (mainly female), and campaigning for equal ones. Somebody who follows feminism is called a feminist.\\n\\nFeminism began in the 18th century with the Enlightenment. The controversy over the differences between the genders led to the discussion of equality.\\n\\nHistory of feminism \\nThe word \"feminism\" comes from the French word \"féminisme\". This medical term was used to describe masculine women or men with feminized traits. When its use became popular in the United States of America, it was used to refer to groups of women who \"asserted the uniqueness of women, the mystical experience of motherhood and women\\'s special purity \".\\n\\nGeneral history \\nFeminism started with the idea that human rights should be given to women. This idea was put forward by some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries such as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill. Later feminists in the early 20th century also said that women should be allowed to vote in a democracy. Many women felt very strongly that they should be allowed to vote and there were many protests. These women were called Suffragettes. This is because they were fighting for Universal suffrage which means everybody is able to vote. The Suffragettes staged many protests for their rights. Some women even committed suicide to show how wrong it was that they could not take part in politics. After women received the vote, feminism worked to make all of society more equal for women.\\n\\nNot all female politicians have been welcomed by feminists, with Margaret Thatcher, Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann being clear examples.\\n\\nFeminism is generally acknowledged to have \"waves\" as different time periods focused on different aspects of feminism, often working off the ideas presented by the wave before.\\n\\nFirst wave (approx. 1830s – early 1900s)\\xa0 \\nIn technical terms, the first wave of feminism could be dated earlier to include pre-nineteenth century women\\'s rights movements. In particular, the French Revolution of 1789 is often attributed as the beginning of the first demands for women\\'s rights. This went on to inspire Mary Wollstonecraft, whose book A Vindication of the Rights of Women was published in 1792. It is widely recognized as one of the earliest significant works of feminist literacy. However, first wave feminism is usually dated as occurring between the mid to late nineteenth century and early 1900s. During the first wave, women began to realize that they must first gain political power before they could bring about social change. This wave focused on gaining the right to vote (universal suffrage). Later, the focus shifted to include sexual, economic, and reproductive concerns.\\n\\nDuring the inter-war years, the feminist movement declined. Anti-feminism was on the rise, focusing on the issue of women and work. Women were being \\'persuaded\\' to return to their traditional roles in the home and give up their war jobs. There were also issues within the organized ranks of feminism itself. The ideologies and priorities of certain groups were changing. Some felt that equality with men had been reached and shifted their focus onto the needs of women as women, such as the subjects of birth control, family allowance, and protective legislature. This caused the split into the dominant groups of equality feminism and new feminism. New feminists focused on the role of traditional women in the home and as mothers. Equality feminists encouraged women to look beyond the home and fought for equality with men in every aspect of life. Equality feminists opposed protective legislature, such as maturity leave, purely on principle.\\n\\nThe topic of protective legislature eventually led to the divide of first wave feminism. Middle-class feminists tended to oppose protective legislature, whereas working class feminists largely supported it. This split between the previously dominant equality feminism and the rising new feminism marks the end of the first wave of feminism.\\n\\nSecond wave (1960s-1980s) \\nSecond wave feminism is marked by the rise of political concerns. Where the first wave of feminism dealt with women in the workforce, as well as the right to own property and vote, the second wave of feminism lobbied for \\'liberation\\' from a patriarchal society. The key to second wave feminism was the struggle over the female body itself - how it was represented and the significance attached to the reality of biological differences.\\n\\nThe famous \"One is not born, but rather becomes a woman\" declaration made by Simone de Beauvoir led to new thinking on the way gender was perceived as a construction, rather than something inherent.\\n\\nSecond wave feminism was also characterized by the problematization of equality. Questions arose about what gaining equality would achieve, due to the societal roles men and women were still expected to fill. This led to the call for extreme change in order to revolutionize the very fabric of a patriarchal society. This was the beginning of the radical, Marxist, and socialist feminist groupings. It also marked a shift in the politics of liberal feminism, focusing more on \\'sexual politics\\', such as the family, abortion, rape, domestic violence, and sexuality.\\n\\nThird wave (1990s – present) \\nThird wave feminism is generally described as the feminism of a younger generation who acknowledge both the effect and the limitations of the ideologies presented by second wave feminism. This new generation argues that the conditions which prompted second wave feminism no longer exist and therefore, feminism needs a revamping in order to be applicable to modern day. It is also argues that second wave feminism catered too much to a small group of people, namely white, middle-class, heterosexual women.\\n\\nThird wave feminists largely seem to have grown up with feminism as a strong concept in society, thus influencing them from a young age. It is taught in schools and is also prominent in the media.\\n\\nThird wave feminists largely focus on issues surrounding individual self-expression. This includes how identity is formed and communicated through things such as appearance, sexuality, and intersectionality. Third wave feminism was also created in order to include a larger grouping of people, recognizing women from different cultural backgrounds, religions, sexualities, ethnicities, and abilities to name a few.\\n\\nFourth wave (approx. 2008 – present) \\nSome say that a fourth wave of feminism is already upon us, prompted by the increase in internet culture. This wave is similar to the third wave but is distinguished by more advanced technology and broader ideas of equality. This wave stands more in solidarity with other social justice movements.\\n\\nFourth wave feminism uses the internet and its \"call-out\" culture to challenge misogyny and sexism in popular media such as television, literature, advertising, etc. This has caused companies to change how they market to women in order to avoid being \"called out\".\\n\\nAnother part of fourth wave feminism is the existence of people who reject the word feminism because of \"assumptions of gender binary and exclusionary subtext: \\'For women only\\'\".\\n\\nIn 21st century online communities/ support groups focused on masculinism discourse as a counterpart to online presence of feminism is known as manosphere.  Masculinism fueled by primordialist ideologies have also resulted into an openly anti-feminist toxic culture known as \"incels\" (involuntarily celibate).\\n\\nWomen in politics \\nThere have been women who have been involved in politics throughout history.\\n\\nHistorical \\nEsther, Lady Godiva, Bodicea, Queen Elizabeth, Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine the Great, Joan of Arc.\\n\\nModern times \\nStarting in 1960, there have been many women elected to high positions of power, such as prime minister. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the first, followed by Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Elisabeth Domitien and Margaret Thatcher. Dame Eugenia Charles lasted nearly 15 years in the post, a record.\\n\\nTypes of feminism/feminist theories\\n\\nLiberal feminism \\nLiberal feminism drew its strength from the diversity of liberal thought following the Enlightenment. The basis of liberal feminism is the emphasis on the power of the individual. If everyone individually stands up for what is right, discriminatory practises will change. Liberals also value education, arguing that equal education of men and women will lead to equality in society. Liberal feminists would be more likely to accept the argument (to a degree) that certain positions in society (such as the home and the workplace) are better suited to the \\'traditional\\' gender placements.\\n\\nSocialist or Marxist feminism \\nSocialist or Marxist feminism are similar in that they both believe revolution is the answer to change. They both link social conditions with capitalism and believe that overthrowing the current system is the only way to get what you want. Like liberal feminists, socialist or Marxist feminists acknowledge that men are necessary as part of the movement for change. Whatever the theory, socialist and Marxist countries have never had women in major government posts. Women have often achieved ministerial positions in democracies. Thus rhetoric (what regimes say) does not always line up with what regimes do in practice.\\n\\nRadical feminism \\n\\nRadical feminism, particularly in the USA, developed from the civil rights and new left clusters. Radical feminists were largely fed up with the male-dominated left wing radicalism and formed the Women\\'s Liberation Movement. This movement was formed in order to create woman-centered politics and to escape from male-oriented politics. They believed this could only be done in a safe women-only space, and this led to the policy of separatism for which radical feminism is best known for. Radical feminists are often misunderstood and seen as \"man-hating\" because of the way their women-oriented politics seem to reject male input.\\n\\nEvangelical feminism \\nEvangelical feminism or \\'Christian feminism\\' was developed from religious movements. Evangelical feminists work to protect and spiritually reform those who need it, such as women and children from outside the church. These feminists believe that everyone is equal under one God and strive to bring that equality to the church and their individual lives.\\n\\nEquality feminism \\nEquality feminism is a subsection of the feminist movement. Equality feminism\\'s focus on the similarities between the sexes is on the basis that men and women\\'s abilities are indistinguishable from their biology. This type of feminism encourages the broadening of horizons, encouraging women to look beyond the home. Its ultimate goal is for the sexes to be completely equal in every part of life.\\n\\nNew feminism \\nNew feminism is a philosophy similar to equality feminism. It focuses on how the differences between men and women complement each other, rather than one sex\\'s biology causing a superiority over the other. New feminism, unlike equality feminism, recognizes the different strengths and roles given to men and women. New feminism advocates for equality in how men and women are treated in their individual roles in society. Its basic concept is the emphasis placed on important differences being biological rather than cultural. Women should be supported as child bearers, both economically and culturally, but this should not be a role that is forced upon them. The main aim is to emphasize the importance of women and men as individuals and that in all senses (legal, social, economic), they should be equal despite their natural differences.\\n\\nGlobal feminist thought \\nGlobal Feminist Thought is primarily the movement of  women\\'s rights on a global scale. Women are impacted in different communities around the world and have common problems they face on a day-to-day basis; usually at home or in the work force. Although different cultural locations have different experiences that will shape their experiences and perceptions, they have common themes. Global feminists tend to focus on nationality (like race, gender and class) and they reach out to help those in developing and third world countries, as well as address oppression created through histories of colonialism and imperialism. It works to end capitalism, imperialism, sexism and racism, along with having everyone considered equal on a global view. It encourages feminists to confront the problems they are facing and reach out for help, as they are not the only ones experiencing that particular problem.\\n\\nLean-In Feminism \\nLean-In Feminism is an approach were women act and behave in a toxic manner and justify their actions by messaging if a man behaved the same way they did, he wouldn’t get called out on it. Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos; Ellen DeGeneres of Ellen DeGeneres Show; Amy Klobuchar, American senator; Chelsea Handler, American comedian; Zoe Sugg, YouTube vlogger etc are considered to be prime examples. This is a negative idea of empowerment seen in social movements that posits women in power are unimpeachable and immune to feminist critique, simply by virtue of the fact that they have achieved such high positions. It is hard to distinguish people of this approach from supportive feminists, because they often cloak themselves with publicity stunts of advocating for all women in order to maintain their hegemony within a kyriarchal system.\\n\\nAnti-feminism \\nWriters such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes misandry (hatred of men) and the elevation of women\\'s interests above men\\'s, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women. Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term \"anti-feminist\" is used to silence academic debate about defects of feminism like lack of intersectionality and visible separatism.\\n\\nCriticism \\nIdentified reasons why some people do not like feminism:\\n People do not like feminism because they think that women are already equal or more important in the eyes of law. Philoandrist\\'s often say that society in general is not equal for men and a version of that is what women experience. Critics say basic tenets like equity and equality in outcome (egalitarian humanism) is a striving factor among men as it is with women.\\n Analysis of feminist theories suggest that in its mid to high levels the topic boils down to aggressive misandry with its separatist and otherness positions (Extremism) rather than being collaborative or supportive. Some say this is reflected in rights in child custody and divorce. Philogynist\\'s say this to be just the toxic side of things.\\n The level of binary thinking with wrong attributions is considered to be a factor. Some example are: Women not regarded as equal to men due to biological differences, the antithetical disregard between women: white vs. women of color, Privilege theory: disregarding existence of ableism among men as among women (Angela Merkel, Melinda Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Tarja Halonen, etc.), viewing women as generally weak and forcing empowerment, etc. Some social areas were these are reinforced: the treatment and role of women in the military, denial of ordination of women in churches (Ephesians 5:21), and partisan policies based on and tied to past events.\\n Some people consider feminism denies strength exhibited by females through maternal and care aspects or discourages these aspects by terming them closely to weakness or slavery.\\n Some people argue that feminism is a showcase of existential crisis between matriarchal and patriarchal systems. It is reflected in radical feminism which  defines liberation as successful totalitarian and forceful overturn of time-honored traditions, religious beliefs, gender roles, relationships, society, culture, power, authority dynamics, and economic structures.\\n Some theorists consider that conscious and unconscious bias is rampant within human beings (Unconscious bias training), such state of oppression is common and an understanding to halt them in destructive forms is what equality should be about.\\n Some people say feminism from its supportive nature is distorted and used for propaganda\\'s like heterosexuality is confinement and distinct female sexuality is liberated only through celibacy, autoeroticism, or lesbianism.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Marie Stopes\\n Valerie Solanas\\n Sexism\\n A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\n Abortion\\n Lesbian\\n Sexual harassment\\n Pornography\\n Prostitution\\n Women\\'s rights\\n Black feminism\\n Fat feminism\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nPolitical movements\\n \\nWomen\\'s rights', '@search.score': 0.010638297535479069, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Extrasolar planet', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar%20planet', 'text': 'An extrasolar planet (or exoplanet) is a natural planet in a planetary system outside our own solar system. \\n\\nIn 2013, estimates of the number of terrestrial planets in the Milky Way ranged from at least 17 billion to at least 144 billion. The smaller estimate studied planet candidates gathered by the Kepler space observatory. Among them are 461 Earth-size planets, at least four of which are in the \"habitable zone\" where liquid water can exist. One of the four, dubbed Kepler-69c, is a mere 1.5 times the size of the Earth and around a star like our own Sun – about as near as the current data allow to finding an \"Earth 2.0\".\\n\\nEarlier work suggested that there are at least 100 billion planets of all types in our galaxy, an average of at least one per star. There are also planets that orbit brown dwarfs, and free-floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do. It is unclear whether either type should be called a \"planet\".\\n\\nAnalogies with planets in the Solar System apply to few of the extrasolar planets known. Most are quite unlike any of our planets, for example the so-called \"hot Jupiters\".\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nEarly speculations \\nIn the sixteenth century, the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of the Copernican theory that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets. Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition. \\n\\nIn the eighteenth century, the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in his Principia. Making a comparison to the Sun\\'s planets, he wrote \"And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of One\".\\n\\nConfirmed discoveries\\nThe first published and confirmed discovery was made in 1988. It was finally confirmed in 2002.\\n\\nIn 1992, radio astronomers announced the discovery of planets around a pulsar. These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation. Otherwise they may be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.\\n\\nOn October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star (51 Pegasi). This discovery, made at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, started the modern era of exoplanetary discovery. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution spectroscopy, led to the quick detection of many new exoplanets. These advances allowed astronomers to detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their parent stars. Additional extrasolar planets were eventually detected by watching occultations when a star becomes dimmer as an orbiting planet passed in front of it.\\n\\nIn May 2016 NASA announced the discovery of 1,284 exoplanets which brought the total number of exoplanets to over 3,000.\\n\\nTypes \\nExtrasolar planets can have many different forms.\\n\\n They can be gas giants or rocky planets\\n They can possibly be dwarf planets, i.e. planets smaller and less dense than regular planets\\n They can orbit several different types of stars\\n They can be free-floating or orbit a brown dwarf\\n They may support life. One recently discovered exoplanet, Gliese 581g is thought to possibly support life, but the existence of this planet is not yet confirmed.\\n\\nNearest \\nThe nearest star with planets is Alpha Centauri. It is 4.3 light years away. Using standard rockets, it would take tens of thousands of years to get there.  The nearest star similar to our Sun is Tau Ceti. It has five planets, one of which in the habitable zone, where liquid water may exist.\\n\\nMost Earth-like \\nSome extrasolar planets might be Earth-like. This means that they have conditions very similar to that of the Earth. Planets are ranked by a formula called the Earth similarity index or ESI for short. The ESI goes from one (most Earth-like) to zero (least Earth-like). For a planet to be habitable it should have an ESI of at least 0.8. For comparison, the four solar terrestrial planets are included in this list.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Planet\\n List of exoplanets\\n dwarf planet\\n 51 Pegasi b\\n 70 Virginis b\\n\\nOther websites\\n\\nSearch projects \\n University of California Planet Search Project\\n The Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search Programmes\\n PlanetQuest distributed computing project\\nExtrasolar Planets\\n\\nResources \\n NASA\\'s PlanetQuest \\n PlanetQuest 3D Atlas of extrasolar planets within 400 light years of our Solar System \\n Planetquest Flash \\n German Center for Exo-Planet Research Jena/Tautenburg\\n Astrophysical Institute & University Observatory Jena (AIU)\\n Table of known planetary systems\\n Extrasolar Planet XML Database \\n Andrew Collier Cameron, Extrasolar planets, Physics World (January 2001).

It was written in 1949 when Germany was split into the countries of East Germany and West Germany. Many parts of the constitution are very different from the constitution of the Weimar Republic.\\n\\nThe writers decided not to call it the constitution because they hoped it would only be a temporary law for West Germany and that the two Germanys would soon be made into one.\\n\\nIt was more than 40 years before East Germany and West Germany became one country again, but the old name of Basic Law has been kept.\\n\\nProtecting the Constitution \\nThe Federal Constiutional Court (German: Bundesverfassungsgericht) protects the constitution by banning laws which break the constitution. There are \"eternal clauses\" in the constitution which the court will protect even by banning constitutional amendments (laws to change them). Article 1, about human life and dignity, and article 20\\'s basic principles are protected from change. This is to make sure nothing like the Nazi period happens again. The Nazis were able to pass an Enabling Act which allowed Hitler to rule by decree.\\n\\nThe Five Constitutional Bodies \\nGermany is a federal parliamentary democracy. To show this there are five \"constitutional institutions\".\\n\\nPresidency \\n\\nThe Federal President () is the head of state. It is largely ceremonial position with only a small role in daily politics. The president does not have the massive power of the president of the Weimar Republic, or the President of the United States.  He is the formal head of state, and signs laws before they can enter into force and appoints federal officials, he cannot decide when to dissolve the Bundestag or name a new chancellor until a majority of the members of the parliament () vote in favour.\\n\\nExecutive branch \\n\\nThe Chancellor is chosen by the Bundestag.  He or she is head of the executive branch, and  heads the federal Cabinet.\\n\\nJudicial branch \\n\\nThe Judicial branch is made up of the Federal Constitutional Court and five other Supreme Courts.  There are also local and regional courts which make the first decision about cases.  Their decisions can be overturnned by the courts of appeal or Supreme Courts.\\n\\nFederal Constitutional Court \\n\\nThe Federal Constitutional Court is the most important court in Germany.  Its job is to protect the Basic Law. Its decisions are like laws. The court can cancel laws if they break the Basic Law.\\n\\nFederal Social Court \\n\\nThe Federal Social Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about social security, pensions and health insurance\\n\\nFederal Labour Court \\n\\nThe Federal Labour Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about labour law.  This includes contracts of employment, strikes and trade union agreements\\n\\nFederal Tax Court \\n\\nThe Federal Tax Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about tax and customs law\\n\\nFederal Administrative Court \\n\\nThe Federal Social Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases involving a government body.  These may be because a person might feel they have been treated unfairly by government or because there is a dispute between two government bodies about which of them is allowed to do something.\\n\\nFederal Supreme Court \\n\\nThis court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases all civil and criminal cases which are not heard by one of the other supreme courts\\n\\nLegislative branch \\nThe legislative branch has two of the constitutional bodies.\\n\\nBundesrat \\n\\nGermany\\'s upper chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat, represents the Länder. It also shows that Germany is a federal state. Federalism is one of the \"eternal clauses\" of the constitution, that can never be changed..\\n\\nBundestag \\n\\nThe Bundestag is the part of the legislature chosen by election.  The Chancellor must be a member of the Bundestag.\\n\\nOther stipulations\\n\\nThe military \\nThe Weimar Constitution had the Reichswehr outside of the control of the parliament or the public. The army directly reported to the president, and the president did not have to report to the parliament. \\n\\nUnder the Basic Law, the Defence Forces Bundeswehr are responsible to parliament, because \\n during times of peace the Bundeswehr reports to the minister of defence\\n during time of war it reports to the chancellor. \\n\\nThe chancellor is directly responsible to the parliament, the minister is indirectly responsible to the parliament because it can remove the government by electing a new chancellor.\\n\\nThe Basic Law also created a soldiers\\' ombudsman or Wehrbeauftragter, reporting to parliament not to the government. Soldiers can write directly to the Wehrbeauftragter if they feel they have been treated unfairly or unlawfully, or if they think their commanders are acting illegally.  Soldiers cannot be punished for writing to the Wehrbeauftragter.\\n\\nA number of Constitutional Court cases in the 1990s said that the Bundeswehr cannot be used by the government outside NATO territory unless the Bundestag first gives permission in a resolution.  The resultion must describe where the Bundeswehr is to go, and for who long the mission will last.\\n\\nReferendums and plebiscites \\nThe Basic Law only allows referendums about changing borders of the Länder. There have been two referundums:\\n\\n Baden-Württemberg was created in 1952 after a referendum approved joining together three separate states (Württemberg-Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and Baden). \\n\\nIn 1996 the people who live in Berlin and Brandenburg decided not to join the two states.\\n\\nDevelopment of the Basic Law since 1949 \\nImportant changes to the Basic Law were the re-introduction of conscription and the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1956.\\n\\nDuring reunification East Germany and West Germany decided not to write a new constitution, but to keep the old one, which had worked so well in West Germany. The constitution was amended to allow East Germany to join, and then changed again to strengthen the claim that Germany wanted no more territory. This was a promise made in the Final Settlement.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n\\nFormer constitutions \\n Constitution of the German Empire (1871-1919)\\n Weimar Constitution (1919-1933)\\n Constitution of the German Democratic Republic (German Democratic Republic; GDR, 1949-1990)\\n\\nOthers \\n Bremen clause\\n Bundesrechnungshof\\n German Emergency Acts\\n History of Germany\\n Politics of Germany\\n Constitution\\n Constitutionalism\\n Constitutional economics\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n Full text:\\n Official English translation (status: December 2000)\\n Original text: HTML, PDF, non-official table of contents (status: August 2006)\\n Former Constitutions:\\n Constitution of the German Empire (1871-1919).

Its origins are not known, but seems to be related to the French Jeu de paume.\\n\\nRules vary from area to area but the common trait is that the ball is struck with a bare, or almost bare, hand (only some minimal protection is applied in some versions of the sport). The general rule involves two teams made from two up to five players each (the numbers depend on the particular version played).\\n\\nThe second characteristic is that it is not played against a wall. Instead, similarly to modern tennis, two individuals or teams are placed face to face separated either by a line on the ground or a net. \\nA distinctive trait of Valencian pilota is that the spectators are often seated or standing very close to the court which means that they may be impacted by the ball and thus become an (unwilling) part of the game.\\n\\nHistory \\n\\nValencian pilota origins are not known with certainty, but it's commonly supposed to be a variant from the middle-aged Jeu de paume, as many other European handball sports (Basque laxoa, French Longue paume, Frisian handball and Italian Pallone) similar to the actual Valencian llargues variant.\\n\\nJeu de paume is documented at Paris in 1292 since there were 13 ball workshops and many tripots (courtfields), it was first played with the hands, and the scoring system was very similar to the current Valencian one. There were so many resemblances with the Valencian pilota sport that, in the 16th century Joan Lluís Vives compared both games in his Dialogues and claimed them to be exactly the same despite some minor differences.\\n\\nOther websites \\n Valencian pilota federation\\n News about Valencian pilota \\n News and shop about Valencian pilota \\n Online one-on-one Escala i corda game, videos and 3D views of a ''trinquet \\n Personal site of Pedro, a Valencian pilotari \\n II Handball World Meeting \\n History of the Pilota, PDF\\n\\nVideos\\nYoutube: 7 videos featuring the 1993 Escala i Corda Individual final match, Genovés I vs. Sarasol I\\nPilota valenciana: Joc i tradició. 15 minutes documentary\\n\\nHandball\\nSport in Spain\", '@search.score': 0.010309278033673763, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Obsessive–compulsive disorder', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder', 'text': 'Obsessive–compulsive disorder (often shortened to OCD) is a mental disorder that causes repeated and unwanted thoughts and/or feelings (obsessions) and actions (compulsions). Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms and can lead the person to believe that if a task is not completed, something bad will happen. Such a task may be washing hands many times, keeping the lights on or even keeping their surrounding clean. This belief leads to more anxiety and tension. The actions that someone takes to stop the thoughts and feelings can take more than an hour every day.\\xa0OCD can limit one\\'s ability to take part in relationships, the workplace, and in society in general. OCD affects around 1.2% of the world\\'s population, and it affects the lives of around 15%. In the United States, about one in fifty adults has OCD.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nObsessions \\nSomeone with obsessive–compulsive disorder has intrusive (unwanted) thoughts called obsessions. An unwanted thought is an obsession that will happen many times and is a thought that the person does not want to have. It is normal to have obsessions, but what changes is how people react to the thoughts. People who do not have OCD are able to ignore bad thoughts and move on, and/or such thoughts do not cause them much distress or anxiety. People who have OCD find it very hard to try and ignore these thoughts. However, just because someone has intrusive (unwanted) thoughts does not always mean they have OCD, but it could mean they have something else. Other brain-based disorders that could result in intrusive thoughts include include Bipolar disorder, Depression, Body dysmorphic disorder, and sometimes Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \\n\\nDifferent people will have different obsessive thoughts. Some people have obsessions about God, the Devil, or another religious figure hurting them or someone they love. Other people have obsessions about sex. They may think about things like kissing, having sex with, or touching people around them. People with OCD may worry that they will act on these thoughts.\\n\\nSome people have obsessive–compulsive disorder without compulsions. This is called \"primarily obsessional OCD\", or \"pure-O\". It is thought that up to half of all people with obsessive–compulsive disorder have primarily obsessional OCD. People with primarily obsessional OCD may have a third type of obsession; that is aggressive thoughts. People with aggressive thoughts may have obsessions about hurting or killing themselves or people around them. Instead of performing compulsions, people with primarily obsessional OCD may act out compulsions in their mind or avoid the things and places that cause the obsessions.\\n\\nCompulsions \\nMany people with obsessive–compulsive disorder act in a certain way to stop the obsessive thought. These specific actions are known as compulsions. To someone with obsessive–compulsive disorder, doing these compulsions are a way to stop the obsessive thought. They may also think that doing the compulsion will stop something bad from happening to them or someone they care about. \\n\\nMany compulsions are similar to body tics, and up to 40% of people with obsessive–compulsive disorder have a tic disorder. Some examples of compulsion include:\\n\\n Relying on people or the internet like Wikipedia to tell them nothing is wrong with them over and over again\\nHand washing\\n Cleaning themselves or things around them\\n Doing something (like turning lights on and off) a certain number of times\\n Putting objects in certain orders\\n Counting to a certain number many times\\n Checking that they did some action, usually checking a certain number of times\\n\\nMany people mistakenly think OCD is only about organizing or cleaning, but it is more than just those two. For example, someone who has excessive fear of disappointing God, fear they will go to Hell upon death, or committing sins is scrupulous, which is OCD based on religion. Compulsions of someone who is scrupulous includes excessive praying, excessive trips to their church, asking their priest the same question if what they did is a sin even though they\\'ve been told it\\'s not, etc.\\n\\nPeople with obsessive–compulsive disorder usually know that their compulsions do not make sense, but do them anyways to stop the feelings of panic or anxiety. People with obsessive–compulsive disorder may do their compulsions for hours every day. Their compulsions can also hurt them, such as compulsive hand washing making their hands red and cut.\\n\\nCauses \\nThe cause of obsessive–compulsive disorder is unknown. There is evidence that genes have a strong role in developing the disorder. If the disorder starts in childhood, it is more likely that other family members will have OCD than if the disorder starts in adulthood. It is thought that obsessive–compulsive disorder is the result of things humans did when they were evolving.stress inducing events also makes ocd severe.\\n\\nDiagnosis \\nThere are four DSM diagnostic criteria for obsessive–compulsive disorder:\\n\\n The person has to have obsessions, compulsions, or both. The DSM defines obsessions as thoughts that happen multiple times that the person does not want. The person has to try to get rid of the thoughts. The DSM defines compulsions as actions done multiple times because of an obsession. These actions are done to reduce the stress caused by an obsession.\\n The obsessions or compulsions take a lot of time or cause lots of problems in the person’s life.\\n The symptoms are not caused by a drug or a different medical problem.\\n The problems are not closer to the problems caused by other mental disorders such as an anxiety disorder or body dysmorphic disorder.\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis \\nThere is another mental disorder similar to obsessive–compulsive disorder called Obsessive–Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. The difference between the two is that people with obsessive–compulsive disorder know that something is wrong and become stressed because of their obsessive thoughts. People with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder do not know that something is wrong, and they like their obsessions and compulsions.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nTherapy \\nBehavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are used to help people with obsessive–compulsive disorder. The therapy works by making people be in places where they have their obsessive thoughts. They are then made to not do their compulsion. Over time, the person becomes used to the place or things that causes them to have their obsessive thoughts. An example of this is someone who is afraid of dirt having dirt put on their hands without being able to wash it off.\\n\\nMedication \\nThe medicines that are usually used are called \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\", or SSRIs. These medicines work by stopping a chemical in the brain called serotonin from working. This causes the obsessive thoughts to happen less. In adults, SSRIs are used for people with moderate or severe issues. In children, SSRIs are used after or with therapy for people with severe issues.\\n\\nIf SSRIs do not work, it is possible for a doctor to give someone with obsessive–compulsive disorder anti-psychotic medicines. Doctors may use both medication and counseling for those with the disorder, and they find that this approach works best.\\n\\nProcedures \\nSurgery can be used to help people if other treatments do not work. In the United States, surgery is not done unless medicine and therapy have not worked multiple times. In the United Kingdom, surgery cannot be done unless cognitive behavioral therapy has not worked.\\n\\nChildren \\nTherapy can be used to reduce the compulsions in children and young adults. Family involvement is very important in treating children. Family also can give the child positive reinforcement for not doing their compulsive behaviors.\\n\\nHistory \\nIn Europe from the 14th to 16th centuries, it was thought that people who had obsessive thoughts were possessed. They would treat these people by performing sometimes dangerous exorcisms to remove the Devil or evil spirit from the person. In the 1910s, a doctor named Sigmund Freud said that obsessive–compulsive disorder was because of fighting in someone\\'s head. He said that these fights start in childhood when someone gains a \"touching phobia\", which fights with the natural want to touch things.\\n\\nSociety and culture \\nThere are several movies and television shows that show people with obsessive–compulsive disorder. The movie The Aviator shows the life of Howard Hughes. Hughes was afraid of germs, and his obsessions and compulsions were about keeping germs away. English footballer David Beckham has talked about his obsessive–compulsive disorder. Television hosts Howie Mandel and Marc Summers have also talked about their obsessions and compulsions.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nAnxiety disorders', '@search.score': 0.010204081423580647, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

If more states recognize it, becoming a  de jure sovereign state will be easier. \\n\\nMany of the territories listed below broke off (separated themselves) from their original parent state, and so they are often referred to as \"break-away\" states. They may have some military protection and informal diplomatic representation abroad. Another state may help them avoid forced reincorporation into its original state.\\n\\nUN member states not recognized by at least 1 UN member state \\n  The Republic of Armenia was independent since 1991 after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Republic of Armenia is not recognized by one UN member state, Pakistan, which has a position of supporting Azerbaijan since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.\\n\\n  The Republic of Cyprus is not recognized by one UN member state, Turkey and one non-UN member state, Northern Cyprus, due to the ongoing civil dispute over the island. Northern Cyprus claims the northeastern half of the island.\\n\\n  The People\\'s Republic of China is the more widely recognized of the two claimant governments of China, the other being the Republic of China (ROC, also known as Taiwan). The United Nations recognized the ROC as the sole representative of China until 1971 when it decided to give this recognition to the PRC instead (see United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758). The PRC and the ROC do not recognize each other\\'s statehood, and each enforces its own version of the One-China policy meaning that no state can recognize both of them at the same time. The states that recognize the ROC (14 UN members and the Holy See as of 20 September 2019) regard it as the sole legitimate government of China and therefore do not recognize the PRC. Bhutan is the only UN member state that has never explicitly recognized either the PRC or the ROC. The Republic of China considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of China (including Taiwan), and therefore claims exclusive sovereignty over all territory controlled by the PRC.\\n\\n  The State of Israel is not recognized by 28 UN members. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) which enjoys majority international recognition as the sole representative of the Palestinian people, recognized Israel in 1993. In January 2018, the Palestinian Central Council voted to suspend recognition of Israel, but the decision has yet to be acted upon. The State of Palestine considers itself to be the legitimate government of the West Bank, much of which is under de facto occupation. The Syrian Arab Republic considers itself to be the legitimate government of the Golan Heights, a territory which Israel claims with limited recognition.\\n\\n  The Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea is not recognized by three UN members: France, Japan and South Korea; and one non-UN member, Taiwan. South Korea considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of Korea, and claims all territory controlled by North Korea.\\n\\n  The Republic of Korea is not recognized by one UN member, North Korea.  North Korea considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of Korea and claims all territory controlled by South Korea\\n\\nUN observer states not recognized by at least one UN member \\n  The State of Palestine is a de jure sovereign state in Western Asia officially governed by the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) and claiming the West Bank and Gaza Strip with Jerusalem as the designated capital; in practice, however, only partial administrative control is held over the 167 \"islands\" in the West Bank, and Gaza is ruled by a rival government (Hamas). Israel regards the area claimed by Palestine as \\'disputed\\' territory (that is, territory not legally belonging to any state). Israel gained control of the Palestinian territories as a result of the Six-Day War in 1967 but has never formally annexed them. The State of Palestine (commonly known as Palestine) was declared in 1988 by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which is recognized by a majority of UN member states and the UN itself as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. Since the end of the first Palestinian Intifada against Israel, the Israeli government has gradually moved its armed forces and settlers out of certain parts of Palestine\\'s claimed territory, while still maintaining varying degrees of control over most of it. The Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which performs limited internal government functions over certain areas of Palestine, was established in 1994. In 2007, the split between the Fatah and Hamas political parties resulted in competing governments claiming to represent the PNA and Palestine, with Fatah exercising authority exclusively over the West Bank and enjoying majority recognition from UN member states, and a separate Hamas leadership exercising authority exclusively over the Gaza area (except for a short period from 2014 to 2016). Palestine is currently officially recognized as a state by 138 UN member states, the Holy See, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The remaining UN member states, including Israel, do not recognize the State of Palestine. The United Nations designates the claimed Palestinian territories as \\'occupied\\' by Israel and accorded Palestine non-member observer state status in 2012. Palestine also has membership in the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and UNESCO.\\n\\nPartially recognized states with de facto control over their territory \\n  Abkhazia in Georgia is a self-declared and more or less functioning independent state. Recognized by the Russian Federation, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. It is situated between the Caucasus and the Black Sea, recognized by the Georgian government as a part of northwestern Georgia. During the Soviet period Abkhazia was merged back with Georgia in 1931 as an autonomous republic within Soviet Georgia. The Abkhazian Soviets proclaimed independence from Georgia in 1992, and a short war ensued from 1992 through 1994. A June 1994 ceasefire has largely held, leaving Abkhazia outside the control of Georgia\\'s central government.\\nUnited Nations member states that are only partially recognized by the totality of the other UN members are not listed here. (For example, 39 countries do not recognize Israel.)\\n\\n  The Republic of China (R.O.C), which controls only Taiwan and some list of islands of the Republic of China since losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949, lost most of its diplomatic recognition and UN seat to the People\\'s Republic of China in October 25, 1971 by UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and now is currently officially recognized by only 23 states. It conducts de facto (all but in name) relations with most countries through institutions such as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices. (See political status of Taiwan).\\n\\n  The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was set up in northern Cyprus in 1975, following the intervention of the Turkish Army in 1974, in response to a coup d\\'état by the Greek junta aiming at \"enosis\". The TRNC declared independence in 1983 and it is recognised only by Turkey. A United Nations proposal to unify the two Cypriot states was accepted by the TRNC, but rejected in a referendum by the Greek Cypriot community, citing security concerns. Further attempts at reunification have thus far been unsuccessful.\\n\\n  South Ossetia in Georgia is a self-declared and more or less functioning independent state with no international recognition from any other nation. After occupation of independent Georgia by Bolshevist Russia in 1921 it became the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within Soviet Georgia. It proclaimed independence from Georgia in 1991, and a ceasefire was declared in 1992.\\n\\n  Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan is (since 1991) a self-declared and more or less functioning independent state but is not recognised as independent.  It is internationally recognized as being part of Azerbaijan, but has an ethnic-Armenian majority.\\n\\nUnrecognized states with de facto control over their territory \\n\\n  Somaliland (since 1991) 1.  Located in north west of Somalia.  In May of 1991, north western clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes five of the eighteen administrative regions of Somalia, corresponding to British Somali Coast Protectorate which is located between Ethiopia, Djibouti, Puntland and the Gulf of Aden. Three regions of north Somalia claimed by Somaliland, Sool, Sanaag and Cayn are disputed with neighbouring Puntland in the north east.\\n\\n  Transnistria (Pridnestrovie), also spelled Transdniestria, is the part of Moldova east of the river Dniester and (since 1990) a self-declared and more or less functioning independent state with no international recognition from any sovereign state. It has a majority Slavic population, as opposed to majority Moldovan which Moldova has. Also known as the Dniester Republic, this de facto state has its own police, army, and currency and functions outside of the jurisdiction of Moldova, however, there is no sign so far of it becoming an internationally recognized country.\\n\\nPartially recognized states largely under military occupation \\n\\n  Western Sahara is a territory claimed and largely administered by Morocco since Spain abandoned the territory in 1976. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic controls the remainder of Western Sahara; it was proclaimed by the Front Polisario in 1976, is recognized by 46 UN member states, and a full member of the African Union. Sovereignty is unresolved and the United Nations is attempting to hold a referendum on the issue through the mission MINURSO. The UN-administered cease-fire has been in effect since September 1991. Western Sahara is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.\\n\\nInternationally administered territory with de facto recognition \\n  Republic of Kosovo is recognized as an independent and sovereign country by 98 UN member states, including the U.S., 23 out of 28 EU members, etc. The International Court of Justice found that Kosovo\\'s declaration of independence did not violate international law.\\n\\nHistoric unrecognized or partially recognized states with de facto control over their territory\\n\\nEurope \\n Banat Republic (proclaimed in 1918). Now part of Romania, Serbia, and Hungary.\\n Baranya-Baja Republic (proclaimed in 1921). Now part of Hungary and Croatia.\\n Carpatho-Ukraine (1939). Now part of Ukraine.\\n  Chechnya (1996-1999).

In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one, hydrogen. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular nucleus of an atom. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups. A row of elements across the table is called a period. Each period has a number; from 1 to 8. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. Elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers.\\n\\nA column of elements down the table is called a group. There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table.  Each group has a number: from 1 to 18. Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways, according to the number of valency electrons, which gives them similar chemical properties (they behave in similar ways).  For example, group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms.\\n\\nThere are two systems of group numbers; one using Arabic numerals (1,2,3) and the other using Roman numerals (I, II, III). The Roman numeral names were used in most of the 20th century.  In 1990 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided to use the new system with Arabic numerals, to replace the two old group systems that used Roman numerals.\\n\\nThe periodic table has been used by chemists to observe patterns and relationships between elements. There are 3 main groups in the Periodic Table; metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. For example, elements to the bottom and far left of the table are the most metallic, and elements on the top right are the least metallic. (e.g. cesium is much more metallic than helium). There are also many other patterns and relationships.\\n\\nThe periodic table was invented by the Russian chemist Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev (18341907).

He is probably the most well known for playing fictional spy James Bond in seven movies from 1973 to 1985. He played James Bond more times than any other actor. He was also well known for playing Simon Templar in the television show The Saint. He began his career by becoming a male model.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMoore was the only child of policeman, George Moore, and housewife, Lilian \"Lily\".  He attended Battersea Grammar School, but was evacuated to Holsworthy, Devon, during the Second World War. He was then educated at Dr Challoner\\'s Grammar School in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. He then attended the College of the Venerable Bede at the University of Durham, but never graduated.  Moore served in the Royal Army Service Corps, commanding a small depot in West Germany.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMoore left his first wife, skater Doorn Van Steyn, for singer Dorothy Squires.  Squires was 12 years older than him.  She was also, at that time, much more famous than he was. They lived together for a short time in Dafen, Llanelli, South Wales. While making a movie in Italy in 1961, Moore left Squires for Italian actress Luisa Mattioli. Moore has a daughter and two sons with Mattioli. Moore ended this marriage in 1993. His current marriage is to the Danish-Swedish multi-millionaire Kristina \\'Kiki\\' Tholstrup.\\n\\nWhen Moore married Kiki Tholstrup, he began spending winters in Crans-Montana, Valais (Switzerland) and summers at his apartment in Monaco.\\n\\nIn 1999, Moore was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), and advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 14 June 2003.  He was proud the honor was for his charity work rather than his acting.\\n\\nOn 11 October 2007, three days before he turned 80, Moore was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Moore\\'s Star was the 2,350th star.  It is appropriately located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard.\\n\\nIn 2008, the French Government appointed Moore a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\\n\\nHis autobiography My Word is My Bond was published the same year.\\n\\nFilmography\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1927 births\\n2017 deaths\\nActors from London\\nActors who played James Bond\\nCancer deaths in Switzerland\\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire\\nDeaths from liver cancer\\nDeaths from lung cancer\\nDeaths from prostate cancer\\nEnglish autobiographers\\nEnglish movie actors\\nEnglish movie producers\\nEnglish stage actors\\nEnglish television actors\\nEnglish voice actors\\nExtras\\nHumanitarians\\nKnights Commander of the Order of the British Empire\\nUnited Nations officials', '@search.score': 0.009900989942252636, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Aquifer', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer', 'text': 'An aquifer is an underground  layer where the material contains water. That can be less solid material like sand, gravel, clay or silt, but it can be rock as well,  as long as the rock allows water to get in (that means that it is water-bearing).\\nFrom such layers or groundwater can be usefully extracted using a well. The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.\\n\\nGroundwater in rock formations \\nGroundwater may exist in underground rivers (e.g., caves where water flows freely underground). This may occur in eroded limestone areas known as karst topography, which make up only a small percentage of Earth\\'s area. More usual is that the pore spaces of rocks in the subsurface are simply saturated with water — like a kitchen sponge — which can be pumped out for agricultural, industrial, or municipal uses.\\n\\nIf a rock unit of low porosity is highly fractured, it can make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), if the water can get through it. Porosity is important, but, alone, it does not make an aquifer. The Deccan Traps (a flood basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock with high porosity but low permeability, so they are poor aquifers. The (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England has a reasonably high porosity, but low grain-to-grain permeability. Much of its good water-yielding characteristics being due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.\\n\\nExamples \\nThe Great Artesian Basin in Australia is arguably the largest groundwater aquifer in the world. (over 1.7 million km²). It plays a large part in water supplies for Queensland and remote parts of South Australia.\\nThe Guarani Aquifer with an area of 1.2 million km² is shared by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\\nThe Ogallala Aquifer of the central United States is one of the world\\'s great aquifers. It underlies portions of eight states, contains primarily fossil water from the time of the last glaciation.  Annual recharge, in the more arid parts of the aquifer, is estimated to total only about 10 percent of annual withdrawals.\\nThe Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) is the world’s largest known fossil water aquifer system.\\n\\nExploitation \\nAquifers can occur at various depths. Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be exploited for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them which can be exploited as groundwater resources. If more water is taken out than get in again one speaks of over-harvesting. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, population growth has led to over-population which has caused the lowering of water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea (saline intrusions). In these cases the aquifer contains brackish water.\\n\\nWhen water seeps (comes slowly) out of the ground, it is called a seep or \"spring (water)\". It usually means there is an aquifer under the ground.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nEcology', '@search.score': 0.009615384973585606, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Selenium', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium', 'text': \"Selenium is a chemical element. Its chemical symbol is Se and its  atomic number is 34. It has 34 protons and 34 electrons and a mass number of 78.96.\\n\\nProperties\\n\\nPhysical properties\\nSelenium (selenium atoms only) has several different forms. They are called allotropes. The most stable of these is a dense gray semimetal (an element that is partially a metal and a nonmetal). The way the atoms are put together is a named a trigonal polymer chain. It lets electricity pass through it better in the light than in the dark. This form is used in photocells. \\n\\nSelenium also has many nonconductive forms: a black glass-like substance, as well as several red crystalline forms. In the red form the eight atoms of selenium form ring to make a molecule. These rings then stack together to make the solid red selenium. The way that red seleniums atoms are put together is similar to sulfur.\\n\\nChemical properties\\n\\nSelenium is not very reactive. It does not dissolve in acids except nitric acid.  It also dissolves in alkali's like sodium hydroxide. It reacts with air when powdered to make selenium(IV) oxide. It does not react with many things, so selenium(IV) oxide is what most selenium compounds are made from.\\n\\nSelenium forms several oxidation states; -2, +2, +4, and +6. The -2 state is in selenides. Selenides are strong reducing agents. They are stronger reducing agents than sulfides. Hydrogen selenide is the acid made from selenide ion. Selenium also reacts with reactive metals to make selenides, such as sodium selenide or aluminium selenide.\\n\\nThe +1 state is found in some selenium compounds, such as selenium(I) chloride. They are the most unreactive selenium compounds.\\n\\nThe +4 state is found in selenites. Selenites and selenous acid are moderate oxidizing agents. It is made by dissolving selenium dioxide in water and making selenous acid. Then selenous acid is reacted with bases to make selenites.\\n\\nThe +6 state is found in selenates. Selenates and selenic acid are powerful oxidizing agents. Selenic acid can even dissolve gold! They are made by reacting hydrogen peroxide with selenium(IV) oxide to get selenium(VI) oxide, which dissolves in water to make selenic acid. Selenates are more reactive than sulfates.\\n\\nMost selenium compounds are colorless. Selenium compounds are not common.\\n\\nChemical compounds\\n-2 compounds\\nSelenides are the most common -2 compounds. Selenides are strong reducing agents.\\nSelenide, the ion\\nAluminium selenide\\nHydrogen selenide\\nSodium selenide\\n\\n+1 compounds\\nSelenium monochloride\\n\\n+4 compounds\\n+4 compounds can exist in anions or cations.\\nSelenium(IV) chloride\\nSelenium(IV) fluoride\\nSelenium dioxide\\nSelenium disulfide\\n\\nSelenites\\nSelenites are weak oxidizing agents.\\nSelenite, the ion\\nSelenous acid\\nSodium selenite\\n\\n+6 compounds\\n+6 compounds can exist in anions or cations, too.\\nSelenium hexafluoride\\n\\nSelenates\\nSelenates are powerful oxidizing agents.\\nSelenate, the ion\\nSelenic acid\\nSodium selenate\\n\\nOccurrence\\nSelenium is very rarely found as an element in the ground. Most selenium in soil is in a very tiny amount. It is easily washed away. It is in very small amounts in the human body. Selenium is found most in sulfide ores like pyrite. This selenium is in selenides. Selenium is gotten as a byproduct. Sometimes selenium is concentrated in plants. It can also be leached into rivers when copper is mined. Too much selenium is bad for a river. Some coal has selenium in it.\\n\\nPreparation\\nIt is made as a byproduct when refining copper and certain other sulfide ores. Selenium is made by oxidizing selenide ores to selenium dioxide. The selenium dioxide is dissolved in acidic water to make selenous acid, which is reacted with sulfur dioxide to make selenium as an element. It is the red form that is made. To make the black form, the red form is heated and melted.\\n\\nUses\\n\\nIn materials\\nSelenium is used in photocells. The gray metallic form is used, as it changes its electrical conductivity when light shines on it. Selenium is also used as a catalyst. The largest use is to color glass red. It can be used in special brasses instead of lead. It is used in some rectifiers. Most use silicon instead. It is used to tone photographs. It can be used to remove dandruff from hair in the form of selenium sulfide.\\n\\nIn the human body\\nSelenium is a trace element in the human body. Humans need very small amounts of selenium. Only about 50-200 micrograms are needed. Selenium can be toxic if more than 400 micrograms are taken. Once there was coal that had a large amount of selenium in it. People were getting selenium poisoning from the coal. \\n\\nSelenium deficiency is rare. Although selenium has some helpful effects on the human body, it also has some harmful effects and only a very little should be eaten.\\n\\nSafety\\nIt is toxic in large amounts. Some selenium compounds are very toxic and harmful to things that live in water. Consuming around 5 mg of selenium per day can kill a human being after a certain amount of time.\\n\\nRelated pages\\nSelenium compounds\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nChemical elements\\nNonmetals\", '@search.score': 0.009259259328246117, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It lived in the later Jurassic period, at the same time as many dinosaurs. Pterodactylus is typical of the short-tailed pterosaurs. The sub-order continued to the end of the Cretaceous, but Pterodactylus is only known from the latest Jurassic.  \\nThe first specimens were found at Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Also found in these strata was the famous Archaeopteryx. \\n\\nThese carbonate strata formed in warm lagoons. Pterodactylus may have lived on small islands in the lagoon, or on the coast. Perhaps it lived further inland and was blown here in a storm. The high salinity would support little life, so the pterosaurs would have fed in some other area.\\n\\nThe first specimen was found in the 18th century, and a description published in 1784. Later, Georges Cuvier worked out that it was a flying reptile. A juvenile pterosaur came to light in 1817, and showed clearly that Cuvier had been right.

Southern Iowa and eastern Illinois also got lots of snow, with 11 inches (28 cm) in Des Moines. In Kentucky this was mostly an ice storm, with some places getting up to 3/4\" (2 cm) of ice. At the same time, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore got a little bit of  snow on February 15. The weather was very cold, and the storm moved very slowly.\\n\\nBut early on February 16, lots of snow started falling in those two cities, and the snow started in Philadelphia. Heavy snow kept coming, falling very fast. It was also very cold, so the snow kept piling up. The heavy snow continued all day, and it reached New York City in the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and that\\'s why the city got less snow than other cities. In the rest of the Northeast, however, the snow stayed for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. Blizzard Warnings were given in New York City and Boston, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and it ended in Boston on the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a few inches of snow to other parts of New England.\\n\\nImpact \\nThis snowstorm slowed down much of the East Coast with its heavy snow. Washington\\'s Reagan National Airport, Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport in New York were closed, and Dulles Airport had one runway open. With snow falling, driving was almost impossible. In Baltimore, the roof of the historic B&O Railroad Museum broke, destroying many valuable engines, railroad cars and train souvenirs.\\n\\nOther websites \\nIn Depth Case Study \\nCNN Article of the Storm\\nCBS Article of the Storm \\nThe Presidents’ Day Weekend Snowstorm of 2003 \\nSnow storm, February 16-17, 2003\\n\\n2003 in weather\\n2003 in the United States\\n2003 in Canada\\nHistoric blizzards in the United States\\nNatural disasters in Canada', '@search.score': 0.009009009227156639, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

After the 16th century, Mongolia were influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. By the end of the 17th century, most of Mongolia was part of an area ruled by the Qing Dynasty. When the Qing Dynasty collapsed in 1911, Mongolia declared independence. But they had to fight against the Chinese. They were helped by the Soviet Union. In 1921, the world accepted its independence.

To play a chromatic scale on the piano every note is played: both white and black notes (e.g. C, C sharp, D, D sharp, E, F etc.).  A chromatic scale can start on any note.\\n\\nMeaning of the word “chromatic”\\n\\nThe word “chromatic” comes from the Greek word “chromos” meaning “color”.  Organists in the 16th and 17th centuries such as Sweelinck liked to write “Chromatic Fantasias”.  These were pieces based on tunes which were chromatic.  In those days, because of the tuning systems used, not all the semitones were exactly the same size.  Going up a chromatic scale would have been like walking up a staircase with steps which were slightly larger or smaller in depth.  This made chromatic scales very interesting and “colourful” which is why they were called “chromatic”.\\n\\nChromatic harmony\\n\\nChromatic harmony means harmony (chords) which use notes which do not belong to the key the music is in (they are not in the key signature).  Although Bach in the 18th century used chromatic harmony it was the 19th century composers who used it more and more.  Wagner wrote music which was very chromatic: there were lots of sharps and flats and it kept modulating to different key areas.  The chord at the beginning of his opera Tristan and Isolde is so famous that it is known as the Tristan chord.  It is very chromatic.  The music is full of tension because it leaves us wondering which key the music is in.\\n\\nRelated pages\\nScale (music)\\nTonality\\nSerialism\\n\\nMusic theory', '@search.score': 0.008403361774981022, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

He is voiced by and influenced by Matt Stone, one of the people who made the show. Kyle is one of the four main characters.  The other three main characters are Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman. He is friends with Stan and Kenny. They are all in fourth grade. They all hang out with Eric Cartman. They do not like him because he can be mean and offensive. Kyle usually acts as the protagonist to Cartman\\'s antagonist. Because Kyle is one of the few Jewish children on the show, he sometimes feels like an outcast between the main group of characters.\\n\\nCharacter\\nKyle lives with his family in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado. He has an adopted brother named Ike.  Ike is from Canada. Both Kyle and Ike are Jewish. Kyle is one of the smartest students in the fourth grade class at his elementary school. Cartman usually makes fun of Kyle because he is Jewish.\\n\\nAppearance\\nKeeping with the animation style of South Park, Kyle is created from simple geometrical shapes. He is not given the same free range of motion like characters that are drawn by hand. In one of the earliest episodes, he was created out of construction paper cutouts and animated with the use of stop motion. Kyle is now animated with computer software. He is shown to give the sense that the show still uses the original animation technique.\\n\\nKyle wears a bright green cap with ear flaps (shapka or bomber-hat), a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens or gloves. When he is not seen wearing his cap (which does not happen very often), he is shown to have a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. He does not like this hairstyle.\\n\\nFamily\\nKyle\\'s father, Gerald is a caring parent to Kyle who usually tries to teach him important morals and ethics. His mother, Sheila is a very overprotective and has a knack for fequently protesting in things that opposes or comes across her ideas or beliefs. Even though her personality sometimes bothers Kyle, he is known to have still loved her and would come to here defense when Cartman would make fun of Kyle\\'s mom. Sheila is based on the stereotype about Jewish mothers. Kyle usually has a good relationship with his parents, although he sometimes would rebel against them.\\n\\nKyle also has one brother, Ike. Ike is his younger brother who was adopted from Canada. In the earlier episodes of the series, Kyle sometimes played a game he called \"kick the baby\", where he would punt Ike into the air. Kyle is shown to be caring for Ike and tries to protect him several times. In addition to his regular family, Kyle has a cousin who shares the same name with him. However, Kyle did not seem to like his cousin and tried to send him away several times.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites\\n Kyle Broflovski  at South Park Studios\\n Kyle Broflovski at KyleFanClub\\nKyle Broflovski at South Park archives, a South Park wiki\\n\\nComedy movie characters\\nFictional characters introduced in 1992\\nSouth Park characters', '@search.score': 0.008130080997943878, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Quantum entanglement', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum%20entanglement', 'text': 'Quantum entanglement is the name given to a special connection between pairs or groups of quantum systems, or any objects described by quantum mechanics. Quantum entanglement is one of the biggest parts of quantum mechanics that makes it hard to understand in terms of the everyday world.\\n\\nExplanation \\nWhen we look at particles, we usually say that each particle has its own quantum state. Sometimes, two particles can act on one another and become an entangled system. When a pair or group of particles can only be described by the quantum state for the system, and not by individual quantum states, we say the particles are \"entangled\".\\n\\nWhen and why do we see entanglement? \\nEntanglement between particles happens because little particles can push and pull on each other, just like big objects do in terms of gravity. If nothing else is acting on those particles, then there are certain things before and after the particles act on each other that have to stay the same. For example, the total momentum of both particles put together would be (roughly) the same before and after they act on each other.\\n\\nHeisenberg\\'s uncertainty principle tells us we can never know the momentum of a particle exactly, or even the total momentum of both particles put together. In fact, we can\\'t ever know exactly what we will measure the momentum of a particle to be before we measure it, but we do know always that the total momentum of the two particles put together doesn\\'t change when the particles act on each other.\\n\\nIn order to be sure that the total momentum is the same before and after the particles act on one another, we need to describe a pair of particles as a single quantum system rather than a pair of quantum systems. If this were not true, the Conservation law for momentum would be violated due to the quantum uncertainty of the momentum of each particle.\\n\\nInteraction \\nEven though each particle has a lot of information about the other, they do not send messages to each other.  There are no messages between the particles saying, \"I\\'m going down, therefore, you must go up\" and waiting for the particle to receive the message. Yet, the particles are always connected and can behave as one.\\n\\nHistory \\nQuantum entanglement is one of the concepts that led Albert Einstein to dislike the theory of quantum mechanics. With his co-workers, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein used entanglement to try to show weaknesses in quantum mechanics. Einstein called entanglement \"spooky action at a distance\". He said this because he did not believe that quantum particles could affect one another faster than the speed of light. He tried to show that this weird effect means that quantum mechanics gives an incomplete picture of what really goes on and that in the future it will be taken care of with extra \"hidden\" variables.\\n\\nErwin Schrödinger talked about entanglement in the same article where he described Schrödinger\\'s cat.\\n\\nYears later, John Bell showed with his theorem that we can tell if this \"spooky action at a distance\" is real or not.  After that, experiments using Bell\\'s theorem proved that entanglement actually happens between tiny particles.\\n\\nUses \\nScientists are trying to use quantum entanglement for many different things. Some things are sending completely secret messages (passing encrypted notes that can\\'t be understood if intercepted), and making computers faster than ever before thought possible. However, entanglement between a pair of particles is a very delicate thing and is easily destroyed. Because of this, it is difficult to use quantum entanglement to do these things. Currently, many scientists are working on making stronger systems where entanglement is stronger and lasts longer to try to do these things more easily.\\n\\nAlthough you can do some things to one particle to try to cause a change in its partner particle, you can\\'t use this (by itself) to send information from one particle to another because it is only possible to control how likely the change will happen. The outcome of whatever measurement you make on a single particle is completely random, and so is the change that results in the partner particle. In other words, changing one particle may change its partner particle, but you cannot guarantee exactly which way you will influence them. Because scientists cannot control exactly what changes between entangled particles occur, it is not possible to use quantum entanglement alone to send messages. If you also send information about the state of the single particle classically (by phone, radio, carrier pigeon, etc.), you can use the entanglement they share to teleport the quantum state of one particle to another particle.\\n\\nAlso, without sending information about the partner particle, there\\'s no way to tell if a given particle is single or half of an entangled pair. With no outside information, a single particle is completely like any other. It\\'s only when you can receive information about the other particle that you will be able to figure out if your particle is one part of an entangled pair. No one can use entanglement to send information faster than the speed of light because you would need another faster than light communicator to do it.\\n\\nMechanics\\nQuantum mechanics', '@search.score': 0.0078125, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Blood', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood', 'text': \"Blood is a liquid in humans and many animals. Blood is pushed through the organism by the heart, and brings nutrients and oxygen to our tissues. It also takes away waste and carbon dioxide from tissues.\\n\\nBlood is made up of blood plasma and various cells — red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Platelets help blood to clot. Hemoglobin is in red blood cells. White blood cells help fight infections and heal wounds.\\n\\nPlasma \\nBlood plasma is the yellow liquid in which blood cells float. Plasma is made up of nutrients, electrolytes (salts), gases, non-protein hormones, waste, lipids, and proteins.\\nThese proteins are albumin, antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), clotting factors, and protein hormones. Plasma that does not have the protein fibrinogen is called serum and cannot clot. Adults have about 3 liters of plasma. Plasma is a liquid, mostly water (90%). Plasma takes up 55% of blood volume.\\n\\nRed blood cells \\n\\nAnother name for red blood cell is erythrocyte. 'Erythro' means red; 'cyte' means cell. RBC is an acronym for red blood cell.\\n\\nRBCs carry oxygen and carbon dioxide around our body. Cells in our body need oxygen to live. Cells also make carbon dioxide as a waste. RBCs bring more oxygen around the body. They also take away the carbon dioxide.\\n\\nRBCs are filled with haemoglobin. This is a protein. It is made to carry a large amount of oxygen. Haemoglobin has iron in it. The iron and oxygen gives haemoglobin its red color. This is why blood is red. Erythropoietin promotes the creation of RBCs. Blood type antigens are carried on the surface of red cells.\\n\\nRBCs also help the blood stay normal pH. The blood needs a to be at a pH of 7.4. If it is much more or less than 7.4 a person can get very sick or die. RBCs are a buffer for the blood pH. Buffer means that it stops changes in pH. The proteins and the carbon dioxide in the RBC are buffers for the blood.\\nIf you do not have enough RBCs, you will die.\\n\\nWhite blood cells \\nWhite blood cells are a big part of the immune system. They attack things that do not belong in the body. They kill germs such as bacteria and viruses. They kill cancer cells. White blood cells also help to fight other toxic substances.\\n\\nWhite blood cells find where the germs are, and start to destroy them. WBCs arrive in the blood. They also go out of the blood in places where there is infection. WBCs do this to fight the germs that make the infection. If they go out of the blood to fight an infection, they may return in the lymphatic system. So WBCs are in lymph nodes. \\n\\nAnother name for white blood cell is leukocyte. Leuko means white. -cyte means cell. WBC is an acronym for white blood cell. There are three main kinds of WBCs. They are lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. Some of the WBCs mature into cells which do similar work in the tissues.\\n\\nThe different WBCs work in different ways. Some WBCs kill and eat germs and cancer cells. Some WBCs make antibodies. These are proteins that stick to a cell and tell other WBCs to kill it. Some WBCs make chemicals. They release these chemicals to fight things that do not belong in the body. These chemicals cause inflammation in a part of the body. When a germ makes someone sick, the body shows it. If a bacteria gets under someone's skin and causes an infection, the skin gets red, hot, and painful. This redness, heat, and pain are signs of inflammation. This shows that WBCs are fighting the infection and killing the bacteria.\\n\\nPlatelets \\nPlatelets help make blood clot. A clot is when the liquid blood becomes solid. The body makes blood clot when the skin is cut. This stops blood from going out of the skin too much. \\n\\nFor blood to be able to clot is essential. But, rarely, some blood clots are bad. If a blood clot happens in a blood vessel going to the brain, it can cause a stroke. If it happens in a blood vessel going to the heart, it can cause a heart attack. This does not usually happen to young, healthy people. \\n\\nPlatelets are not the only things that make clots. There are proteins in the blood that help make clots. Both platelets and clotting proteins are needed to make good clots.\\n\\nWhere blood comes from \\n\\nBlood cells are made in the bone marrow and in the spleen. The bone marrow is the soft material in the middle of bones. Special cells in the bone marrow make most of the blood cells in your body.\\n\\nPlasma proteins are made mostly by the liver. The water and electrolytes in plasma come from the food and water that you eat.\\n\\nAlthough blood is a fluid, in some respects it is a kind of connective tissue. Its cells  originate in bone marrow and the spleen, and in the blood there are potential molecular fibres in the form of fibrinogen. These are activated when a blood clot forms.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nBasic English 850 words\\nBiochemistry\\nCardiovascular system\", '@search.score': 0.007633587811142206, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

His father was an officer in the United States Army Air Force. He studied at Yale University and at Boston College Law school. Kerry was raised as a Roman Catholic by his Catholic father and Episcopalian mother.\\n\\nIt was discovered in 2003 by Felix Gundacker, a genealogist working with The Boston Globe, that Kerry\\'s paternal grandparents, who had been born Jewish, as \"Fritz Kohn\" and \"Ida Löwe\", in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, changed their names to \"Frederick and Ida Kerry\" in 1900 and converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism in 1901\\n\\nCareer\\nIn 1968 and 1969, Kerry was a United States Navy officer in Vietnam. During the 2012 Obama reelection campaign, Kerry participated in one on one debate prep with the president, impersonating the Republican candidate Mitt Romney.\\n\\nKerry\\'s vice presidential candidate was John Edwards. The ticket lost the election to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.  One of the reasons Kerry lost is because people said he was an elitist (he did not understand most Americans) and also because a group called \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" attacked his service in Vietnam.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Kerry once apologizes after saying that college students needed to study hard or else they would \"get stuck in Iraq.\"\\n\\nSecretary of State\\nOn December 21, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. The committee said yes on making Kerry the new Secretary of State. Kerry won confirmation by the Senate on January 29, 2012 by a 94-3 vote. He assumed the office of Secretary of State on February 1, 2013. \\n\\nIn a letter to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, Kerry announced his resignation from the Senate effective February 1. Kerry was sworn in as Secretary of State on February 1, 2013.\\n\\nSpecial Envoy for Climate Change\\nOn November 23, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced that Kerry will serve as the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate in the Biden administration. He was sworn in on January 20, 2021, the same day Biden was inaugurated as president.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nHe was married to Julia from 1970 until they divorced in 1988. Then he was married to Teresa Heinz since 1995. He has two children and three step-children. He now lives in Boston, Massachusetts. Kerry and his former competitor George W. Bush share an ancestor on Kerry\\'s mother\\'s side and Bush\\'s father\\'s side from the 1600s.\\n\\nKerry is 6\\xa0ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall, enjoys surfing and windsurfing, as well as ice hockey, hunting and playing bass guitar. According to an interview he gave to Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, Kerry\\'s favorite album is Abbey Road and he is a fan of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, as well as of Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Buffett. He never liked heavy metal. During his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry used Bruce Springsteen\\'s \"No Surrender\" as one of his campaign songs.

      "{'title': 'Zanzibar', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar', 'text': 'Zanzibar is the name of an archipelago in the Indian Ocean 25–50\\xa0km off the coast of East Africa. There are many small islands and two large ones: Unguja (the main island, sometimes informally referred to as \\'Zanzibar\\') and Pemba Island.\\n\\nThe archipelago was once the separate state of Zanzibar, which united with Tanganyika to form Tanzania (derived from the two names). Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous within the union, with its own government.\\n\\nThe capital of Zanzibar is Zanzibar City. It is on the island of Unguja.  The city\\'s old quarter, known as Stone Town, is a World Heritage Site.\\n\\nThe people are mostly African Bantu, with some Asians of Indian origin.\\n\\nPolitics\\nZanzibar has its own government, known as the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar. It is made up of the Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives.\\n\\nThe main Parties are the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) and the Civic United Front (CUF). Since the early 1990s, the politics of the archipelago have been marked by repeated violent clashes between these two political parties.\\n\\nIndependence claimed \\nIn October 2009, Zanzibar President Amani Karume met with CUF Secretary Seif Shariff Hamad at the State House to discus how to save Zanzibar from future political turmoil and to end the backlash between them, a move which was welcomed by many people including the USA and political parties. It was the first time CUF agreed to recognize Karume as the legitimate president of Zanzibar.\\n\\nThe relationship between Zanzibar government and Tanzanian Mainland has not been good in recent years since Tanzania Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda\\'s remark about the Isles\\' sovereignty. He said that Zanzibar is not an independent country outside the Union Government, within which it can only exercise its sovereignty.\\n\\nMembers from both the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) disagreed with Mr Pinda\\'s interpretation and stand firmly in recognizing Zanzibar as a fully autonomous and full state. The move was not recognized by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania.\\n\\nIn 2008, Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete tried to silence the debate when he addressed the nation in a live conference by saying that Zanzibar is a state internal but semi-state international. There the matter rests for the time being.\\n\\nA proposal to amend Zanzibar’s laws to allow rival parties to form governments of national unity was adopted by 66.4 per cent of voters, after official results of a referendum which was held on July 31, 2010.\\n\\nReligion \\nZanzibar is 95% Islamic in religion, and has been so for hundreds of years. It was once part of the Persian Empire, then under the Caliphate of Oman. It was ruled by a Sultan. Zanzibar was conquered by the British in the late 19th century. The islands were involved in the Arab slave trade, and the British conquest was an attempt to stop this. They appointed puppet rulers, and Zanzibar became a \\'protectorate\\', not a colony.\\n\\nZanzibar gained independence on 10th December 1963 from the British.\\n\\nSpices \\nZanzibar\\'s main industries are spices (which include cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper), raffia, and tourism. Zanzibar is also the home of the endemic Zanzibar Red Colobus and the elusive Zanzibar Leopard.\\nThe word \"Zanzibar\" probably derives from the Persian زنگبار, Zangi-bar (\"coast of the blacks\") and it is also known as Zanji-bar in Arabic. Zanzibar is sometimes referred to as the \"Spice Islands,\" a term that is more often used for the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. Pemba Island is the only island apart from Zanzibar that still produces cloves on a major basis which is the primary source of spice income for the islands.\\n\\nEconomy \\nThe islands are poor, and the economy is in trouble. Zanzibaris are living a hard life compare to the mainland. In 2000, the annual income per capita was US$220.\\n\\nDuring May and June 2008, Zanzibar suffered a major failure of its electricity system, which left the island without electricity for nearly a month. Another blackout happened from December 2009 to March 2010, due to a problem with the submarine cables and the local plant. This led to a serious and ongoing shock to the island\\'s fragile economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign tourism.\\n\\nCloves \\nZanzibar\\'s economy is based primarily on the production of cloves (90% grown on the island of Pemba), the principal foreign exchange earner. Exports have suffered with the downturn in the clove market.\\n\\nThe clove, originally from the Moluccan Islands (Indonesia), was introduced to Zanzibar by the Omani sultans in the first half of the XIX century. Zanzibar, mainly Pemba Island, was once the world\\'s leading clove producer, but annual clove sales have plummeted by 80% since the 1970s. Zanzibar\\'s clove industry has been crippled by a fast-moving global market, and international competition.\\n\\nTanzania\\'s failed experiment with socialism in the 1960s and 1970s, when the government controlled clove prices and exports, is also a factor. Zanzibar now ranks a distant third with Indonesia supplying 75% of the world\\'s cloves compared to Zanzibar\\'s 7%.\\n\\nOther options \\nZanzibar exports spices, seaweed and fine raffia. It also has a large fishing and dugout canoe production.\\n\\nTourism is a major foreign currency earner. A number of new hotels and resorts having been built in recent years.\\n\\nThe Government of Zanzibar legalized foreign exchange bureaux on the islands. The effect was to increase the availability of consumer commodities. The government has also established a free port area. This stimulates trade and support services. There is a management system for re-exportation of goods.\\n\\nThere is also a possibility of oil exploration in Zanzibar on the island of Pemba. Oil would help boost the economy of Zanzibar, but there have been disagreements about dividends between the Tanzanian mainland and Zanzibar, the latter claiming the oil should be excluded in Union matters. A Norwegian consultant has been sent to Zanzibar to investigate its oil potential.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nGeography of Tanzania', '@search.score': 0.007352941203862429, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It is easy to operate. The coffee it can make is stronger than that produced by other means.\\n\\nA French press has a round jug. This jug can be glass or clear plastic. The jug has a lid and a \"plunger\". The plunger fits in the jug very well. It usually has some kind of steel or plastic wire, that acts as a filter. Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together, leaving to brew for a few minutes, then pushing the plunger down. This puts the coffee at the bottom of the jug.\\n\\nThe French press has different names around the world.  In Australia, South Africa and Ireland it is known as a coffee plunger and coffee brewed in it is known as plunger coffee.  Its French name is cafetière à piston. Sometimes it is also called a melior (from an old brand of makers of coffee pots of this type) or a Bodum (another brand).  In the UK the device is known as a cafetière (the French word for \"coffee pot\").\\n\\nBecause the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the brewing water, coffee brewed with the French press gets more of the coffee\\'s flavour and essential oils. These usually are trapped in a traditional drip brew machine\\'s paper filters.  French pressed coffee is often stronger and thicker than drip-brewed one. It also has more sediment.  Because the grounds remain in the drink after brewing, French pressed coffee should be served quickly. Over time, the drink will develop a bitter taste. This is because the grounds still act on the water.\\n\\nCoffee for use in a French press should be ground coarsely.  The use of a burr mill grinder gives a better grind than the whirling blade variety.  The ground coffee should be more coarse than that used for a drip brew coffee filter, and far coarser than that used for espresso. Anything other than a coarse grind will go through the press filter and into the coffee.  A French press can also be used instead of a tea infuser to brew loose tea.\\n\\nThe French press is also more portable than other coffee makers.  Special versions for travellers also exist. They are made of tough plastic instead of glass. They also have a sealed lid with a closable drinking hole.  Some versions are marketed to hikers and backpackers. These people often do not want to carry a heavy metal percolator or a filter using drip brew.\\n\\nDespite the name, the French press is not noticeably more popular in France than in other countries. In most French households, coffee is  prepared by drip brewing, with an electric coffeemaker and paper filters. In bars and restaurants, an espresso machine is used.\\n\\nSome studies have found that drinking large amounts of coffee made by the French press method increases LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels, while drinking filtered or drip coffee does not.  The French press method allows certain Diterpenes, such as Cafestol and Kahweol, to remain in the coffee while other brewing methods either remove or limit these chemicals.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\nFrench Press Coffee How To Guide  A step by step guide about how to make French Press Coffee\\nHistory of the French press\\nCoffeeGeek: How to use a Press Pot\\n\\nKitchenware', '@search.score': 0.007299270015209913, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

The story is about a vampire called Dracula, who wants to take over England. The novel happens in 1893.\\n\\nPlot\\nA young solicitor (a type of lawyer) Jonathan Harker goes to the country Transylvania to sell a house in England to a nobleman named Dracula. After living in the castle for a week, he realizes that Dracula is a vampire that wants to take over England. Dracula traps Harker in his castle with three other vampire women (who are called his brides) and goes to England, by hiding on a ship and killing the crew. When he gets to England, he bites a young woman called Lucy Westenra and turns her into a vampire. Lucy is then killed by Abraham van Helsing (a vampire hunter) and the other characters in the book.

      "{'title': 'Bram Stoker', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram%20Stoker', 'text': 'Abraham \"Bram\" Stoker (8 November 1847 – 20 April 1912) was an Irish writer. He is  best remembered as the author of the classical and influential vampire (or devil) novel Dracula.\\n\\nLife \\nHe was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent—then as now called \"The Crescent\"—in Clontarf, a coastal suburb of Dublin, Ireland. His parents were Abraham Stoker (born in 1799; married Stoker\\'s mother in 1844; died on 10 October 1876) and the feminist Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (born in 1818; died in 1901). Stoker was the third of seven children. Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Church of Ireland and attended the Clontarf parish church (St. John the Baptist) with their children where both were baptised. Until he started school at the age of seven—when he made a complete, surprising recovery—Stoker was sick. During that time, Stoker wrote, \"I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.\"\\n\\nAfter his recovery, he became a normal young man even excelling as an athlete at Trinity College, Dublin (1864–70), from which he was graduated with honors in mathematics. He was auditor of the College Historical Society and president of the University Philosophical Society, where his first paper was on \"Sensationalism in Fiction and Society\". In 1876, while he was employed as a civil servant in Dublin, he wrote theater reviews for The Dublin Mail, a newspaper partly owned by fellow horror writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu. His interest in theater led to a lifelong friendship with the English actor Henry Irving. In 1878 Stoker married Florence Balcombe, a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was Oscar Wilde. The couple moved to London, where Stoker became business manager of Irving\\'s Lyceum Theater, a post he held for 27 years. The collaboration with Irving was very important for Stoker. Through him he became involved in London\\'s high society, where he met, among other notables, James McNeil Whistler and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the course of Irving\\'s tours he got the chance to travel around the world.\\n\\nThey had one son, Irving Noel Stoker, who was born on 31 December 1879.\\n\\nDracula \\n\\nHe earned his money by writing a large number of sensational novels, his most famous being the vampire tale Dracula which he published in 1897. Before writing Dracula, Stoker spent eight years researching European folklore and stories of vampires. Dracula is an epistolary novel, written as collection of diary entries, telegrams, and letters from the characters, as well as fictional clippings from the Whitby and London newspapers. Stoker\\'s inspiration for the story was a visit to Slains Castle near Aberdeen. The bleak spot provided an excellent backdrop for his creation.\\n\\nDracula has been the basis for countless movies and plays. The first was Nosferatu directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlock. Nosferatu was produced while Florence Stoker, Bram Stoker\\'s widow and literary executrix, was still alive. Represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors, she eventually sued the filmmakers. Her chief legal complaint was that she had been neither asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the movie. The suit was finally resolved in the widow\\'s favour in July 1925. Some copies of the movie survived, however, and Nosferatu is now widely regarded as an innovative classic. The most famous movie version of Dracula is the 1931 production starring Bela Lugosi and which spawned several sequels that had little to do with Stoker\\'s novel.\\n\\nStoker wrote several other novels dealing with horror and supernatural themes, but none of them achieved the lasting fame or success of Dracula. His other novels include The Snake\\'s Pass (1890), The Jewel of Seven Stars (1903), and The Lair of the White Worm (1911).\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\nNovels \\n The Primrose Path (1875)\\n The Snake\\'s Pass (1890)\\n The Watter\\'s Mou\\'  (1895)\\n The Shoulder of Shasta (1895)\\n Dracula (1897)\\n Miss Betty (1898) \\n The Mystery of the Sea (1902)\\n The Jewel of Seven Stars (1903)\\n The Man (AKA: The Gates of Life) (1905)\\n Lady Athlyne (1908)\\n Snowbound: The Record of a Theatrical Touring Party (1908)\\n The Lady of the Shroud (1909)\\n Lair of the White Worm (1911)\\n\\nShort story collections \\n\\n Under the Sunset (1881)\\n Dracula\\'s Guest (1914) Published posthumously by Florence Stoker\\n\\nUncollected stories \\n Bridal of Dead (alternative ending to The Jewel of Seven Stars)\\n Buried Treasures\\n The Chain of Destiny\\n The Crystal Cup (1872)- published by \\'The London Society\\'\\n The Dualitists; or, The Death Doom of the Double Born\\n The Fate of Fenella (1892), Chapter 10, \"Lord Castleton Explains\" only.\\n The Gombeen Man\\n In the Valley of the Shadow\\n The Man from Shorrox\\'\\'\\'\\n Midnight Tales The Red Stockade The Seer Non-fiction \\n The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland (1879)\\n A Glimpse of America (1886)\\n Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving (1906)\\n Famous Impostors (1910)\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Blood from the Mummy\\'s Tomb (film adaptation of The Jewel of Seven Stars\\'\\')\\n Bram Stoker Award\\n\\nReferences and notes\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n Bram Stoker cultural Heritage visitor centre , Dublin\\n \"Bram Stoker: A Biography of the Author of Dracula\" \\n h2g2 article on Bram Stoker\\n Bram Stoker\\'s brief biography and works\\n The Lair of the White Worm  - dedicated site (film and novel)\\n 20 Common Misconceptions and Other Miscellaneous Information\\n\\nOnline texts \\n\\n Full text of Dracura at the Project Gutenberg in various formats.\\n Bram Stoker Full text and PDF versions of most of Stoker\\'s works.\\n Bram Stoker Books in HTML format.\\n\\n1847 births\\n1912 deaths\\nIrish novelists\\nWriters from Dublin', '@search.score': 0.006289307959377766, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

The Kerala flood in India was another flood that has destroyed people's houses.\\n\\nDuring a flood, people try to move themselves and their most precious belongings to higher ground quickly.

If people drink this dirty water, they may suffer from diseases such as typhoid and cholera, hepatitis and other such diseases. People can get ready to survive a flood by filling many containers with fresh and clean drinking water and storing other emergency supplies; like: medicine and food. During flood people try to go to higher sides because the flood water wouldn't reach high areas. Also drains overflow and mix with clean water and people who drink it might fall ill.\\n\\nCauses of floods \\nFlooding is usually caused when a volume of water within a water body, such as a lake, overflows outside it.Sometimes if a dam breaks, it suddenly releases a large amount of water. The result is that some of the water travels to land, and 'floods' the area.Many rivers are in a channel, between river banks. They flood when the strength of the river causes it to flow beyond the banks. This is more common at bends or meanders. Flood damage can be prevented by moving away from places that flood. However, people have long liked to have their homes and businesses alongside water because water is good for agriculture and transport and in other ways. Floods are also caused due to improper management of drains. Rainfall is the most common cause. Snow melt is also a cause of flooding. Tsunamis and Storm Surge are less common ways that floods happen. Coastal Flooding is another common cause of flooding, and this is caused by low pressure systems or storms.You can control floods by improving the drainage and grading of your home. Installing a flood detection system in your home also helps to prevent flooding.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Flood control\", '@search.score': 0.0062500000931322575, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It first flew in 1972 and was introduced in 1977. It is designed to drop bombs, fire rockets, missiles, and its 30\\xa0mm Gatling Gun at enemies on the ground (like tanks). It is named after the World War II P-47 Thunderbolt. It is not as fast as most military jets, but it is tough, heavily armored, and can turn well. The A-10 is also used as a CAS (close air support) aircraft, which involves flying slowly over a target area and destroying any targets in that area.\\n\\nThe A-10 is 53 feet, 4 inches (16.16 meters) long, 14 feet, 8 inches (4.42 meters) high, has a wingspan of 57 feet, 6 inches (17.42 meters), can go 420 miles per hour, and can weigh 51,000 pounds (22,950 kilograms) at heaviest. It is armed with a 30\\xa0mm GAU-8 Gatling gun, and can have a few tons of bombs or missiles. It can also carry radar-jamming pods so it cannot be seen on radar, and chaff, which can confuse missiles fired at the A-10.\\n\\nThe Gun \\n\\nWhile the A-10 has a lot of room on its wings to carry bombs and missiles, its main weapon is the gun, called the GAU-8 Avenger. It is a very long and heavy gun called a Gatling cannon, since it is a both an autocannon (fires large bullets very fast) and Gatling gun (has more than one barrel, which spin while being shot) The Avenger is so big that the A-10 had to be built around it, which created the joke that the A-10 does not have a gun attached like other warplanes, but it is the Avenger that has a plane attached. The A-10 is the only airplane to use the Avenger.  Other American planes instead use the smaller Vulcan, which is also a Gatling cannon but with a smaller bullet.\\n\\nBecause the Avenger fires such big bullets (artillery shells 3\\xa0cm wide, which also explode) at such a high rate of fire (up to 40 every second) many believe it can destroy any target very easily, even tanks with thick armour such as the M1 Abrams. This is wrong. The bullet can go through thin metal on a car or truck, but it cannot penetrate the thick metal covering a tank. It can only destroy them because most tanks only have thin metal on their top to make them lighter. If an A-10 manages to shoot there, then it is bad for the tank, but if it shoots the front or side where the metal is thicker, then the tank will not be damaged.\\n\\nRugged aircraft  \\n\\nThe A-10 is reportedly a rugged aircraft.  On April 7, 2003, then-Captain Kim Campbell felt a loud hit to her A-10.  The aircraft rolled left and pointed toward the ground.  After trying other procedures, she turned off the hydraulics and flew the aircraft in manual reversion.  The aircraft performed fine during the hour flight back to the air base.  However, landing was tricky, because she had no brakes nor ground steering without hydraulics.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n P-47 Thunderbolt\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nUnited States Air Force aircraft', '@search.score': 0.0060606058686971664, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

In the end the ones that are copied are a memetic success.\\n Jokes spread and change the more they are told.\\n Proverbs\\n Gossip\\n Nursery rhymes: passed on from parent to child over many generations (thus keeping old words such as \"tuffet\" and \"chamber\" popular when they are not used today).\\n Epic poems: once important memes for preserving oral history; writing has largely superseded their oral transmission.\\n Conspiracy theories\\n Recipes\\n Fashions\\n Religions: complex memes, including folk religious beliefs, such as The Prayer of Jabez.\\n Popular concepts: these include Freedom, Justice, Ownership, Open Source, Egoism, or Altruism\\n Group-based biases: everything from anti-semitism and racism to cargo cults.\\n Longstanding political memes such As \"mob rule\", national identity, Yes Minister and \"republic, not a democracy\".\\n Programming paradigms: from structured programming and object-oriented programming to extreme programming.\\n Internet phenomena: Internet slang. \"Internet memes\" propagate quickly among users using email, websites, blogs, discussion boards and other Internet communications as a medium.\\n Moore\\'s Law: this meme is particularly interesting.

The city is 3,500\\xa0km2  in size.\\n\\nHistory \\nPeople started living in the Muscat area about 2300 years ago but the first writings of the city are about 1900 years old in the 1st century CE.  Muscat developed into an important city in the 9th century CE because of business and trade at the port.  Portugal, Persian (Iran) and Turkey had many wars for control over Muscat from the 1500s to the 1700s.  The Al Bu Sa 'id tribe has ruled Muscat since then.\\n\\nClimate and weather \\nMuscat is a hot and dry city.  The average daytime temperature in summer can be as high as 40\\xa0°C.

      "{'title': 'Tooth', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth', 'text': 'A tooth is one of the hard, white things in the mouth. Teeth (plural) are used to help the mastication process by chewing food. Chew means to break up and crush food so it can be swallowed (pushed down into the stomach). \\n\\nMost vertebrates have teeth. Birds are the biggest group that do not. Many invertebrates have mouthparts which, to some extent, act like teeth. Different animals have different kinds of teeth because they eat different foods. Some animals use teeth as a weapon. Human adults usually have 32 teeth. Human children usually have 20 teeth.\\n\\nNatal teeth \\nSome human babies are born with teeth. Natal teeth are teeth that are present at birth. These are different from neonatal teeth which are teeth that emerge during the first month of life. Natal teeth are not common. They occur in about 1 out of every 2–3 thousand births. They are usually found on the lower jaw. Natal teeth are usually not well attached and may easily wobble.\\n\\nTeeth eruption \\nDeciduous teeth or milk teeth or temporary teeth are the first set of teeth for most mammals.  Humans have 20 of them. The first teeth (called \"primary teeth\") start to erupt (come through the gums of the jaw) when a baby is about 6 months old. When these teeth erupt it can really hurt. Babies chew on things to make the pain better. This is called teething (verb: to teethe). Most children have all 20 teeth by two or three years of age. \\n\\nAt age 6–7 the permanent teeth start to erupt. By the age of 11–12 most children have 28 adult teeth. The last four teeth, called \\'wisdom teeth\\' or third molars come in by age 17–21 in most people. Some people never grow wisdom teeth. Or they may have only two instead of four.\\n\\nTeeth structure \\n\\nThe outside white part of teeth is called the enamel. The enamel is made of calcium phosphate and is very hard. Under the enamel is the dentine. The dentine is softer than the hard enamel. So it is hurt more by tooth decay (cavities). Under the dentine is the pulp which has the nerves and blood vessels that go to the tooth. This is the part that causes the pain of a toothache. Cementum is outside the dentine where there is no enamel. Cementum holds the tooth to the bone of the jaw.\\n\\nTypes of teeth \\n Incisor\\n Canine tooth\\n Premolar\\n Molar\\n\\nHealthy teeth \\nIf they are protected and kept clean, teeth should stay for a person\\'s whole life. Many people lose their teeth early because they do not do the right things to keep teeth healthy. \\n\\nSome things people can do to keep teeth healthy:\\n Brush teeth after every meal and at bedtime with a soft-bristled brush.\\n Floss after every meal (but at least once a day at bedtime). Flossing should be done before brushing!\\n Drink water with fluoride before brushing. Or, use a fluoride mouthrinse (but not for children under age 6).\\n See a dentist every 6 months for a tooth exam and tooth cleaning.\\n Eat a healthy diet.\\n Sugars like sucrose and glucose are bad for teeth.\\n Milk and cheese are good for teeth because they have calcium.\\n However, milk contains lactose which can cause cavities. Due to this, drinking a lot of milk can still cause cavities.\\n Unsweetened (no sugar) chewing gum helps clean teeth, and makes salvia and removes food particles.\\n Nothing with flavor in-between meals, give your saliva the two to three hours it needs to clean teeth. The saliva can not do that if there is a continuous food film being put on to the teeth. \\n Dehydration leads to less saliva production. Drink plenty of water every day.\\n\\nDisease of teeth \\nPlaque is the soft white substance that forms on teeth when they are not cleaned. It has bacteria in it that hurt enamel. If plaque is not cleaned off, after 2 days it can become tartar. Tartar is a hard substance that forms on teeth (mostly near the gums).  Tartar makes gums unhealthy and makes more bacteria grow on the teeth.\\n\\nPlaque is cleaned off with a toothbrush. If tartar forms on teeth, a dentist must clean it off. \\n\\nThe bacteria that are on teeth eat into the enamel. Cleaning and flossing teeth, eating good foods, and having a dentist take off plaque make less bacteria on teeth. If there is too much bacteria, they eat enamel faster than teeth make enamel. This makes holes in enamel called cavities. When a person gets cavities, he has the disease dental caries. Making cavities in enamel happens slowly. But once cavities go through enamel, the soft dentine is hurt much faster. Cavities may be fixed by dentists.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Dental formula\\n Dentition\\n Dentures\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n The New Student\\'s Reference Work Wikisource\\n Tooth Citizendium\\n\\nBasic English 850 words', '@search.score': 0.005780346691608429, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It was written by Adam Smith in 1776, who was a Scottish man. It looks at division of work, following self-interest, and freedom of trade.\\n\\nThe book was not the beginning of classical economics, and market economics. Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves, the result would be best for society. Before that, economics was about the king\\'s personal interests, and the wealth of a nation was measured by the king\\'s treasury or by the gold and silver in the country. \\n\\nSmith said what\\'s important is what\\'s best for the whole nation, and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation. He wanted to discover how wealth can grow, and how people could do things to support that growth. Smith\\'s book said land, labour, and capital were the three \"factors of production\" and the main contributors to a nation\\'s wealth.\\n\\nPrices naturally adjust to having more or less of something: supply and demand. If there is too much of something (more supply), prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it. If a lot of people want something (high demand), there may not be enough of it (scarcity); there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it, and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want, and prices go up. \\n\\nSmith said markets should be free. At the time, some big companies (like the East India Company) were controlled by the government. Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers. For example, in the American colonies, colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it. They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing, then buy it back after it was finished. Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society. He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference. Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price. This way if people did what was best for them, it would end up being best for society as a whole, almost like an \"invisible hand\" was guiding everything.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n18th-century books\\nNon-fiction books\\nEconomics books', '@search.score': 0.005464480724185705, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

The bishop is the leader of the Christians and the Christian priests in each diocese. The diocese which a bishop governs is called a bishopric. Episcopal is the adjective for bishops. A cathedral is the church building where the bishop has an episcopal throne. The cathedral is the main church of the diocese and the bishop's see. A bishop may be given the rank of archbishop in an archdiocese. \\n\\nChristian priests in some denominations must be made priests by bishops. In these denominations, bishops are above parish priests in the hierarchy of the church's organization. However, some Protestant denominations have no bishops or archbishops. The Presbyterianism is an example. The leader of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator. The General Assembly elects the Moderator of the Church of Scotland each year. Other Christian movements have neither bishops nor priests: Quakers are one example.\\n\\nIn the Catholic church, the Pope is chosen by all the cardinals from amongst their number. According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378).\\n\\nThe pope is also 'the Bishop of Rome'.  In fact he rules an independent state within Rome, called the Vatican.  All Roman Catholic bishops answer to the pope (or to patriarchs in some orthodox churches).

She was an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society.  Only 116 people have ever been made honorary members.  She was the wife of the conductor Sir John Barbirolli.  She was born Evelyn Rothwell, and was always known by that name until after the death of her husband, John Barbirolli, when she changed her professional name to “Evelyn Barbirolli”.  She became famous at a time when there were very few women in orchestras.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nEarly years\\n\\nEvelyn Rothwell’s father was a tea dealer in the City of London.  Her mother was related to Charles Reade, a 19th century novelist.  She started to learn the oboe at her school, Downe House, near Newbury.  Her father did not want her to study music, but in the end she was allowed to go to the Royal College of Music.   She studied the oboe there, and the piano as a second instrument.  She also played the cello and timpani.  She was a student there at the same time as Benjamin Britten, who sometimes asked her to play some of the oboe music he had just written.\\n\\nEvelyn started her professional career as an oboist in the Drury Lane orchestra.  She soon got a job with the Royal Opera House touring company whose conductor was John Barbirolli.  Barbirolli was married, but his marriage did not last long.\\n\\nBarbirolli was then made conductor of the Scottish Orchestra (now called the Royal Scottish National Orchestra).  He gave Evelyn the job of first oboe in this orchestra.  He made an arrangement of a concerto by Handel for her to play.  She played several other concertos with him conducting, and they made several recordings.  Vaughan Williams was very pleased with their recording of his oboe concerto.  Several composers wrote music especially for her.  Henry Wood made her first oboist in the New Queen’s Hall Orchestra.\\n\\nYears of marriage\\n\\nEvelyn married Barbirolli in 1939, after he had divorced his first wife.  By this time Barbirolli was conductor of the New York Philharmonic.  He had taken this job after Toscanini had left.  Barbirolli and his new wife lived in New York until 1943 when they returned to England so that Barbirolli could be the conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester.  Sometimes she played in the orchestra, but not very often because she thought people might say that it was because her husband was the conductor.  When the Hallé Orchestra went to Austria in 1948 she played Mozart’s oboe concerto with them.  People at that time only knew this work in an arrangement for the flute.\\n\\nIn Manchester Evelyn helped her husband by being his secretary.  She drove him everywhere, and was always by his side at rehearsals to help him.  As Barbirolli gradually became ill she spent nearly all her time with him instead of playing the oboe.  She travelled with him to America when he became conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra.  Barbirolli kept working hard although he was not well.  During his last years they had financial problems when Barbirolli’s manager caused them to lose a lot of money.\\n\\nAfter Barbirolli’s death\\n\\nAfter Barbirolli’s death in 1970 she started to play her oboe again.  She taught at the Royal Academy of Music, and was always known as “Lady Barbirolli” (or “Lady B”).  She often adjudicated at music competitions.  Her pupils respected her for her honesty and kindness.  She wrote a book about Oboe Technique and the Oboist’s Companion, a book in 3 volumes.  She also wrote an autobiography called Living with Glorious John.  She was made an OBE in 1984.

It is composed of microtubules. They help propel cells and organisms in a whip-like motion. The flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an “S” motion, and is surrounded by cell membrane.\\n\\nFlagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller Cilia. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum Undulipodia. Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum Ciliophora. Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.\\n\\nCilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.\\n\\nTypes \\nThree types of flagella have so far been distinguished; bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic. The main differences among these three types are summarized below:\\n\\n Bacterial flagella are helical filaments that rotate like screws. They provide two of several kinds of bacterial motility.\\n Archaeal flagella are superficially similar to bacterial flagella, but are different in many details and considered non-homologous.\\n Eukaryotic flagella – those of animal, plant, and protist cells – are complex cellular projections that lash back and forth.  Eukaryotic flagella are classed along with eukaryotic motile cilia as undulipodia to emphasize their distinctive wavy appendage role in cellular function or motility.  Primary cilia are immotile, and are not undulipodia; they have a structurally different 9+0 axoneme rather than the 9+2 axoneme found in both flagella and motile cilia undulopodia.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n Molecular Machines Index of Illustrations, Graphics, and Animations \\n Physics Today introduction to the bacterial flagellum by Howard Berg \\n\\nProtista\\nOrganelles\", '@search.score': 0.0051282052882015705, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Peanut', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut', 'text': 'A peanut is a plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, Central America and Mexico.  Peanuts are annual herbaceous plants growing 30 to 50\\xa0cm (1 to 1.5\\xa0ft) tall.\\n\\nOverview\\nThe peanut plant flowers above ground, then develops its pods underground. Because of this, peanuts are often called groundnuts. Other names include goobers, pinders, arachides (French/Italian), and maní (Spanish). This strange legume yields shell-covered pods (fruits) that contain one or more seeds. A nut is a hard shelled fruit that comes from a plant whose fruit does not open to release its seed. A nut is a composite of the fruit and seed, some examples of true nuts are: acorns, beechnuts, chestnuts and hazelnuts.\\nSo despite the name, the plant is not a nut in the biological sense, but a legume.\\nPeanuts grow by starting out as an above ground flower that, due to its heavy weight, bends towards the ground. The flower eventually burrows underground, which is where the peanut actually matures. \\n\\nThe veined brown shell or pod of the peanut contains two or three peanut kernels. Each oval-shaped kernel or seed is comprised of two off-white lobes that are covered by a brownish-red skin. Peanuts have a hardy, buttery and \"nutty\" taste. \\n\\nPeanuts go by various names throughout the world with \"goober\" or \"goober pea\" being one of the most popular. Goober is derived from \"nguba,\" the name for peanut in the Bantu language spoken in parts of Africa. Peanuts are known scientifically as Arachis hypogaea.\\n\\nIn food\\nPeanuts are a favorite food, whether eaten alone as a snack food or mixed into candy, cookies, pies, and other bakery products. Peanut butter, made by grinding the roasted seeds, accounts for about one half the peanuts grown in the United States. Worldwide however, peanuts are grown chiefly to provide peanut oil. Farmers in Africa and Asia grow about 90 percent of the world\\'s peanuts. \\n\\nPeanuts have been cultivated in South America for a very long time. Today most peanuts are eaten roasted and salted. Peanut butter peanut brittle and candy bars are also often eaten. There are two kinds of peanut butter - chunky and creamy. Most American children prefer the chunky kind.\\n\\nThe U.S. introduced the peanut to the tropical South America, and India, China, West Africa, and itself to become the largest commercial producers of peanuts. The peanut was grown mainly for its edible oil, except in the U.S., where it was produced for grinding into peanut butter, for roasted, salted nuts; and for use in candy and bakery products. A small percentage of the U.S. crop is crushed for oil. In the southern U.S. the peanut is used extensively as feed for livestock.\\n\\nNutrition\\nPeanuts are a very good source of monounsaturated fats, the type of fat that is important in the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet. Studies of diets with a special emphasis on peanuts have shown that this little legume is a big ally for a healthy heart.\\n\\nIn addition to their monounsaturated fat content, peanuts feature an array of other nutrients that, in numerous studies, have been shown to promote heart health. Peanuts are good sources of vitamin E, niacin, folate, protein and manganese. In addition, peanuts provide resveratrol, the phenolic antioxidant also found in red grapes and red wine that is thought to be responsible for the French paradox: the fact that in France, people consume a diet that is not low in fat, but have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to the U.S. Numerous research studies, including the Nurses\\' Health Study that involved over 86,000 women, have found that frequent nut consumption is related to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nTypes of Peanuts \\nFour types of peanuts are the most popular: Spanish, Runner, Virginia, and Valencia. There are also Tennessee Red and Tennessee White types. Certain types are preferred for particular uses because of differences in flavor, oil content, size, and shape. For many uses the different types are interchangeable. Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type, along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell. Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy, salted nuts, and peanut butter. Most Runners are used to make peanut butter.\\nThe various types are distinguished by branching habit and branch length. There are numerous varieties of each type of peanut. \\n\\nEach year new varieties of peanuts are introduced somewhere in the peanut belt of the U.S. or in other countries. Introducing a new variety may mean change in the planting rate, adjusting the planter, harvester, dryer, cleaner, sheller, and method of marketing. There are two main growth forms: bunch and runner. Bunch types grow upright, while runner types grow near the ground.\\n\\nSpanish Types\\nThe small Spanish types are grown in South Africa, and in the southwestern and southeastern U.S. Prior to 1940, 90 percent of the peanuts grown in Georgia were Spanish types, but the trend since then has been larger seeded, higher yielding, more disease resistant varieties. \\n\\nVarieties of the Spanish type include Dixie Spanish, Improved Spanish 2B, GFA Spanish, Argentine, Spantex, Spanette, Shaffers Spanish, Natal Common (Spanish), White Kernel Varieties, Starr, Comet, Florispan, Spanhoma, Spancross, and Wilco I. \\n\\nRunner Types\\nSince 1940, there has been a shift to production of Runner type peanuts in the southeastern U.S. This is due to higher yields and wider use in peanut butter and salting, as compared to Spanish types. \\n\\nVarieties of Runners include Southeastern Runner 56-15, Dixie Runner, Early Runner, Virginia Bunch 67, Bradford Runner, Egyptian Giant (also known as Virginia Bunch and Giant), Rhodesian Spanish Bunch (Valencia and Virginia Bunch), North Carolina Runner 56-15, Florunner, and Shulamit. \\n\\nVirginia Types\\nThe large seeded Virginia types are grown in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Georgia. They are increasing in popularity due to demand for large peanuts for processing, particularly for salting, confections, and roasting in the shells. \\n\\nVirginia type peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit. The bunch type is upright to spreading. It attains a height of 18 to 22\\xa0inches, and a spread of 28 to 30\\xa0inches, with 33 to 36\\xa0inch rows that seldom cover the ground. The pods are borne within a few inches of the base of the plant. \\n\\nVarieties of Virginia type peanuts include Virginia Bunch Large, Virginia Bunch 46-2, Virginia Bunch Small, Virginia Bunch 67, Virginia Bunch G2, Virginia Runner G26, NC 4X, NC 2, NC 5, Georgia Hybrid 119-20, Holland Jumbo, Holland Station Runner, Adkins Runner, Virginia Runner 26, Virginia Runner G (Holland Virginia Runner), Virginia 56 R, Virginia 61 R, Florigiant, Georgia Hybrid 119-18, Virginia B22-15, Virginia A17-12, Virginia A23-7, and Florida 416. \\n\\nValencia Types\\nValencia types are coarse, and they have heavy reddish stems and large foliage. They are comparatively tall, having a height of 50\\xa0inches and a spread of 30\\xa0inches. Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches. Most of the pods are clustered around the base of the plant, and only a few are found several inches away. Valencia types are three seeded and smooth, with no constriction between the seeds. Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods. There are two strains, one with flesh and the other with red seeds. The seed count is 65 to each ounce. \\n\\nTennessee Red and Tennessee White Types\\nThese are alike, except for the color of the seed. The plants are similar to Valencia types, except that the stems are green to greenish brown, and the pods are rough, irregular, and have a smaller proportion of kernels.\\n\\nRelated pages\\nPeanut butter\\nNuts\\n\\nReferences \\n\\n \\nVegetables', '@search.score': 0.004975124262273312, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

He is described as conservative politically by a mainstream source. He describes himself as a paleoconservative politically, which means that he advocates old or traditional forms of political conservatives, as opposed to the newer forms, i.e. neoconservatives. He also calls himself an \"aggressive constitutionalist\". He is a conspiracy theorist.\\nJones claims that the USA was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.\\nJones is the host of The Alex Jones Show on Genesis Communications Network.\\n\\nBiography\\nJones was born in Dallas, Texas  and grew up in the suburb of Rockwall. His father is a dentist. He attended Anderson High School in northwest Austin, Texas. Jones was a lineman on his high school\\'s football team.\\n\\nHe began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format Public-access television cable TV program. In 1996, Jones switched format to KJFK, hosting a show named The Final Edition. In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed By Design.\\n\\nIn 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new Branch Davidian church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government\\'s siege of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas. He often featured the project on his Public-access television program and claimed that Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the ATF during the siege.\\n\\nIn 1999, he tied with Shannon Burke for that year\\'s \"Best Austin Talk Radio Host\" poll as voted by The Austin Chronicle readers. Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM. According to the station\\'s operations manager, Jones was fired because his viewpoints made the show hard to sell to advertisers and he refused to broaden his topics. Jones argued: \"It was purely political, and it came down from on high [meaning it was ordered by powerful people]\", and, \"I was told 11 weeks ago to lay off Clinton, to lay off all these politicians, to not talk about rebuilding the church, to stop bashing [slang for criticizing] the Marines, A to Z.\"\\n\\nIn early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open seat swing district based in Austin, Texas.

By contrast, a cappella specifically refers to unaccompanied singing. The word(cantata) etymologically comes from the Italian word “cantare” which meant “to sing”.  The word “cantata” was used mainly in the 17th and 18th century to describe music with religious words that were sung by a choir or by soloists or both, accompanied by instruments. The most famous cantatas are those by Johann Sebastian Bach. Nearly all his cantatas are sacred(written for church services). Very often he used Lutheran hymn tunes (chorales) for the first and last movements. In between there are movements for solo singers: recitatives and arias. A famous example is Bach's cantata no 80 which is based on the chorale “Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott(“A safe stronghold our God is still”). The whole work is about being safe in the hands of God. This is what the sermon would have been about. The congregation would join in singing the chorale towards the end of the cantata.\\n\\nOther composers, such as Alessandro Scarlatti (1660-1725) wrote cantatas which were secular(not religious). The word “cantata” has also been used in the 20th century by composers such as Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) and Benjamin Britten (1913-1976).\\n\\nThus the term came to apply to any and all forms of accompanied songs.\\n\\nMusical forms\", '@search.score': 0.004761904943734407, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It is a  rocket  tall, and  wide. It has flown 79 times, since its first flight on August 21, 2002. It was developed from the Atlas (missile). Unlike the Space Shuttle, Atlas V is only used once, with a new rocket being built for each flight.\\n\\nThe rocket is made of the first stage, a Common Core Booster with an RD-180 engine from Russia. Every Atlas V has this as the first stage. The second stage is called Centaur, and has one/two RL-10 engines from Aerojet Rocketdyne. On top is a  wide fairing covering the spacecraft during launch.\\n\\nFlights \\nAs of the end of 2018, the Atlas V has made 79 flights.  The most famous ones carried the New Horizons, Mars Science Laboratory (which had the Curiosity rover in it), Juno, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter/LCROSS, the Boeing X-37B, the Mars 2020 mission which carried the Perseverance rover and the Mars Helicopter Ingenuity, and in the future, the launch vehicle for Boeing's CST-100 Starliner used for crewed flights to the International Space Station.\\n\\nVariants \\n\\nThe Atlas V has a special way of naming the different kinds. The Atlas V nomenclature for numbering the variants goes like this: The first number says how wide the fairing is. A 400 series Atlas V has a 4-meter wide fairing. A 500 series Atlas V has a 5-meter wide fairing. An Atlas V N22 have no fairing since it will be the launch configuration for the Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. second number says how many strap-on solid rocket boosters the rocket has. An Atlas V 501 has no strap-on boosters, an Atlas V 441 has 4 strap-on boosters, while the Atlas V N22 has two strap-on boosters, which will be the Boeing Starliner launch configuration. The last number says how many engines the Centaur second stage has. All of the Atlas V rockets flown have had only 1 engine on the Centaur, but in the future other Atlas V rockets will have 2 engines on the Centaur upper stage, such as the Atlas V N22 that I frequently mentioned in this article. There is also the HLV which has two of the first stage (Common Core Booster) strapped on like strap-on boosters, but it has never flown.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Juno\\n Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\\n Mars Science Laboratory\\n NASA\\n New Horizons\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nRockets\", '@search.score': 0.004694835748523474, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Phenylketonuria', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria', 'text': \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder (a disease a person is born with) where a person's body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. Amino acids are necessary to make proteins, an important part of the human body. Phenylalanine only comes from the food we eat; our bodies do not make any by themselves.\\n\\nHow it works \\n\\nAverage people produce an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase in their bodies. When they ingest phenylalanine, the body cannot use it, so this enzyme changes phenylalanine into tyrosine, which the body can use. In people with PKU, very little or no enzyme is made. Since the phenylalanine they eat is not being changed into tyrosine, it builds up in their bodies. This can cause problems with the way their bodies work.\\n\\nSymptoms  \\nSymptoms vary from person to person. Because of the rarity of PKU, many symptoms go undiagnosed or unrecognized. In addition, there are variations in the categories of PKU individuals. There are untreated, early treated, late treated, those returning to diet, Hyperphe, Classical PKU, uncontrolled, and highly controlled. For your average infant a doctor will diagnose PKU with a quick blood test. Their symptom will be high PHE levels. If that infant goes undiagnosed for weeks or months, he/she may start to exhibit some or all of the following symptoms for uncontrolled PKU. The symptoms include:\\n\\n focus/concentration problems \\n seizures\\n lowered intelligence\\n tremors\\n problems with memory \\n gait (walking) problems\\n anxiety\\n skin problems\\n depression \\n mousy odor\\n aggression\\n irritability\\n phobias \\n mental fog\\n slower thinking and response \\n hyperactivity\\n lethargy\\n social anxiety\\n decreased motor function and hand/eye coordination\\n fatigue\\n psychotic symptoms\\n mild paralysis\\n autistic behaviors\\n social withdrawals \\n lack of autonomy\\n social maturity deficits \\n decreased positive emotions\\n low self-esteem\\n\\nTreatment \\n\\nToday, scientists know what foods have phenylalanine in them, and they have created a special diet for people with PKU. Since they cannot use it, people with PKU cannot eat foods that have a lot of phenylalanine, like eggs, meat and milk. An artificial sweetener called aspartame is also a source of phenylalanine. People with PKU take a lot of vitamins to make up for the foods they cannot eat, especially vitamins B6 and B12.\\n\\nBabies with PKU are fed a special formula.  It has everything babies need to stay healthy, but with very little phenylalanine. There are also low protein foods like breads and flour (Made from corn and starch instead of regular wheat).\\n\\nWomen with PKU who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have to be especially careful to follow this diet. If they do not follow the diet, their babies could be born with severe birth defects and mental retardation. Babies born to women with PKU who have followed the PKU diet throughout their pregnancy are usually healthy and do not necessarily but may develop PKU. Whether or not they have PKU themselves depends on the mother and father's genes. In fact there are people who are Carriers  (Dormant Genes) that can be passed on until they resurface in the future generations. These are so far undetectable, However, since PKU is genetically recessive it takes PKU genes from both parents to cause PKU.\\n\\nPKU kids usually have light hair and eyes due to the effect of phenylalanine in the production of melanin.  They also tend to have very fair skin which can cause them to burn easily. Solar protection is a must for those who wish to work, play, or engage in activities outdoors.\\n\\nFuture \\n\\nMost people with PKU can live as long and healthy as anyone else if the low-phenylalanine diet is started when they are babies and continued for the rest of their lives. The symptoms will usually disappear after the diet is started.\\n\\nOther websites \\n \\nGenetic disorders\", '@search.score': 0.004545454401522875, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

      "{'title': 'Dyslexia', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia', 'text': 'Dyslexia is a learning disability, a condition that makes it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. It is a very common problem.\\n\\nIt effects on the way the brain understands words. The most common signs of dyslexia are reading and writing problems. Estimates are that in the United States between 5 and 9% of school children have dyslexia, though estimates go as high as 50%. \\n\\nThere are many dyslexia types.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nA person can have dyslexia even if they are intelligent and educated. Recent studies show there are many small business owners that have dyslexia; between 35 and 50 percent of U.S. and British entrepreneurs are affected. Researchers think many dyslexic entrepreneurs are successful because they can delegate responsibilities (of writing letters) and still be good at speaking.\\n\\nAt the end of the 19th century, scientists did a lot of research about dyslexia and found some of the reasons that people are dyslexic. A professor who did research in the 1980s and 1990s looked at the brains of dyslexic people who had died.  He found that some parts of the brain were not connected very well, and that this happened during the fourth month of pregnancy. This problem has a big effect on the left half of the brain. The newest research shows that three genes are the reason for dyslexia.\\n\\nOne thing that causes dyslexia is a problem with the central hearing nerve. This problem can not be found with a normal hearing test, so a special doctor has to do special tests to find it. It means that people with heavy dyslexia are sensitive to loud noise, may have problems speaking, and may not be able to concentrate. It may also cause problems with rhythm and melody of music.\\n\\nMany people who have dyslexia also have other mental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\\n\\nFinding dyslexia\\nIn order to tell if a child has dyslexia, they have to be seen by a doctor. A child can be called dyslexic if they cannot read or write well and there is no other reason for the problem. Doctors are trying to create early tests to help find out whether a child has dyslexia before they are old enough to go to school. If this happens, a child can start to be treated very early, and they may have fewer problems at school. Many well-known people have dyslexia, including: Stephen Hawking, Jamie Oliver, Whoopi Goldberg, Ozzy Osbourne, Jay Leno, John de Lancie, Keira Knightley, Susan Hampshire, Orlando Bloom, Keanu Reeves, Richard Branson, Henry Winkler, Patrick Dempsey, Albert Einstein, and Tom Cruise. These people though continue to thrive with their work.\\n\\nTherapy\\nChildren with dyslexia can be helped. One way teachers help dyslexic students is to break words into different sounds. The student must learn how to write the different sounds and create words. This helps with reading and writing. Some people think that dyslexic children can read and write better if they put pieces of colored paper on top of what they are reading.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRelated pages\\nDysgraphia\\nNeurodiversity\\n\\nDisability\\nDisorders', '@search.score': 0.004444444552063942, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

It serves as a check, that no errors have been made when writing down the number. In its simplest form, the digits are simply added up. This can however not detect errors of swapping digits around. Better ways (algorithms) of calculating a checksum are to use a Hamming code, a cyclic redundancy check or modular arithmetic. One of the uses of checksums is to check that account numbers have been entered correctly. \\n\\nPortuguese bank account identifiers are a good example of how checksums work. They have 21 digits. The first 19 digits identify the bank, branch and account number.  The last two digits are \"mod 97\" checksum digits based on modular arithmetic. A typical Portuguese bank account number is 0002.0123.12345678901.54. The digits have the following meanings:\\n\\nThe digits \"0002\" represent the bank.\\nThe digits \"0123\" represent the branch of the bank.\\nThe digits \"12345678901\" represent the account number\\nThe digits \"54\" represent the checksum.\\n\\nIf 000201231234567890154 (the bank account number without the dots) is divided by 97, the answer is 207458809978249 remainder 1. Since the remainder is \"1\", the bank account identifier is probably correct. If the person writing down the number missed a digit, swapped two digits around or wrote a digit down incorrectly the remainder would not have been \"1\". If this is the case then the computer should detect an error and give an error message.   \\n\\nAnother place where checksums are used are serial numbers for computer software.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nComputer science', '@search.score': 0.0044247787445783615, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

All teas are made from the Camellia sinensis plant.\\n\\nSometimes the word \"tea\" is used for other drinks that have been made by soaking fruit or herbs in hot water, like \"rosehip tea\" or \"camomile tea\". These are called \"herbal teas\".\\n\\nTypes of tea \\nThere are three main types of tea: black tea, oolong, and green tea.\\n\\nTo make black tea, workers take the leaves and spread them out on shelves where they can dry. Next they are rolled and broken into pieces and put into a room where they absorb oxygen, or oxidize. Chemical reactions change the taste and style of the tea. Finally the leaves are dried with hot air until they turn brown or black. Most black tea comes from Sri Lanka, Indonesia and eastern Africa. When black tea leaves are brewed in boiling water, the tea made from them looks deep dark red, so another name used for black tea, especially in China, is red tea. \\n\\nThe process for oolong is similar to making black tea. It is made by partially oxidizing the tea leaves, rather than fully oxidizing them.  Rutter’s has tea.\\n\\nGreen tea is made by putting freshly picked leaves into a steamer. This keeps them green. Then they are crushed and dried in ovens. India is the biggest maker and user of green tea.\\n\\nTea is mainly grown in China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Japan, Nepal, Australia, Argentina and Kenya. \\n\\nThe word tea can also be used as another word for an afternoon meal (mostly in the Commonwealth countries), as in \"I am having tea in a short while.\"  The word also applies to \"afternoon tea\", a small snack meal served sometimes, usually featuring sandwiches, cakes and tea.

They write these articles and stories by interviewing people, asking questions, and doing research.\\n\\nReporters must tell the truth in their reports.  Telling the truth is a very important part of all journalism jobs.  Those who do not tell the truth may be punished like other workers who do not do their work.

They are very ancient, and can be seen in all mammals.\\n\\nEmotions are caused by a complex mixture of hormones and the unconscious mind. Only with great difficulty can we control our emotions by conscious effort. They cause mammals to change behaviour according to changes in their situation. In our case they sometimes run against our attempt to live our lives in a logical way.\\n\\nA scientific definition is not simple; over 90 definitions have been offered by experts. A definition of emotion needs to includes three things:\\nconscious experience (feelings)\\nexpressions which can be seen by others\\nactions of the body (\\'physiological arousal\\')\\n\\nHere  is one definition:\\n\"Emotion is a complex psychological phenomenon which occurs as animals or people live their lives. Emotions involve physiological arousal, appraisal of the situation, expressive behaviours, and conscious experience. Emotion is associated with feeling, mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation\".\\n\\nIn physical terms, emotions involve body systems which have operated for hundreds of millions of years. These are the hormone system, the autonomic nervous system and the \\'lower\\' brain centres (hindbrain and midbrain).\\n\\nFunction of emotions \\n\\nThe study of emotions became one of Darwin\\'s books after The Descent of Man. He published The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1873. He had discovered, by sending letters and a list of questions worldwide, that in different societies emotions were expressed in almost the same way.\\n\\nIf so, the mechanisms which made the expressions must be inherited. They must have been developed in the same way as all other features of man, evolution by natural selection. It was already known from anatomy that the muscles and nerves of the face were the same or similar in all humans.\\n\\nDarwin illustrated the expression of the emotions with a series of photographs and woodcut illustrations. Ekman did the same thing on a research visit to New Guinea, where he asked villagers to identify the emotions shown in the photographs. This was part of a long-term effort to test and extend Darwin\\'s insights into emotions. Some of Ekman\\'s conclusions are:\\nMicro expressions last only a fraction of a second. They occur when people conceal their feelings. (p15, p222)\\nEmotions are autoappraisers, reactions to matters which seem to be very important to our welfare. (p21)\\nEmotions often begin so quickly that we are not aware of the processes in our mind which set them off. (p21)\\nAutoappraisers scan for events which are critical to our welfare and survival. (p23)\\nOur evolutionary heritage makes a major contribution to the shaping of our emotional responses. (p26)\\nThe desire to experience or not to experience an emotion motivates much of our behaviour.

He was best known for being a member of London hard rock band Led Zeppelin. Bonham is considered one of the greatest rock drummers of all time.\\n\\nJohn Bonham\\'s career started in 1967, when he joined the Band of Joy with singer Robert Plant. After having some success, the band broke up. At around the same time, another band called The Yardbirds also broke up. Soon after this, Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist for the Yardbirds, decided to start a new band. This new band, called Led Zeppelin, had Plant on vocals, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards, Bonham on drums and Page playing guitar.\\n\\nBonham died after choking on his own vomit in his sleep after drinking forty shots of vodka, and bassist John Paul Jones found him the next morning.\\n\\nLed Zeppelin\\nAfter playing some small gigs throughout England, the band came out with their first album, named Led Zeppelin I. John Bonham\\'s talents can be heard on such songs as \"Good Times, Bad Times\", featuring his single bass drum skip throughout the song. Soon after this, the band left for a tour of America, on Boxing Day (26 December 1969). After a rather successful tour, Zeppelin came out with their second album, naming it Led Zeppelin II. This album included the song \"Moby Dick\", which had a famous drum solo by Bonham. Throughout the solo, Bonham showed off his talents by playing hand drums while continuing to use his right foot.\\n   \\nBy this time, Led Zeppelin was becoming more well known. With the release of their third album (not surprisingly named Led Zeppelin III), they became one of the biggest bands in the world. Bonham\\'s featured song on this album, which he wrote, was \"Out On The Tiles\". \\n\\nLed Zeppelin later released the albums Led Zeppelin IV (which was originally unnamed), Houses of the Holy, and Physical Graffiti. During this time, Zeppelin was touring non-stop. In addition to still playing \"Moby Dick\", Bonham also received attention for his work on songs such as \"Four Sticks\", \"The Ocean\", and \"In My Time Of Dying\". \\n\\nSoon after Physical Graffiti, the band took time off because Robert Plant was injured in a car crash. In this time off, besides spending time with his family and tinkering with cars, Bonham was working on their next album, Presence.\\n\\nDeath\\nOn 24 September 1980, Bonham was picked up by his personal assistant, Rex King. They were going to a rehearsal for the upcoming tour. During the day, Bonham drank many alcoholic beverages. After the rehearsal the band left and went to Page\\'s house. The next day, Benji LeFevre, Led Zeppelin\\'s new tour manager, and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead.\\n\\nThe coroner ruled that Bonham had drank forty shots of vodka, and his cause of death was pulmonary edema. Bonham had vomited in his sleep, and suffocated on his own vomit.\\n\\nAfter Bonham died, Led Zeppelin decided to quit because they felt that Bonham was too good to be replaced.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n Led Zeppelin Official Site\\n John Bonham Dedicated Site\\n Drummerworld John Bonham Page\\n The 23 John Henry Bonham Drum Outtakes\\n\\n1948 births\\n1980 deaths\\nDeaths from pulmonary edema\\nDrug-related accidental deaths in the United Kingdom\\nEnglish rock drummers\\nEnglish songwriters\\nLed Zeppelin\\nMusicians from Worcestershire', '@search.score': 0.0042372881434857845, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",
